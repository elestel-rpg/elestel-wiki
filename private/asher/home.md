## Andramia notes:
Adramia and Uri met when she came to the Library (at age 113) after spending time at her family estate

Andramia served under Uri Thaloma as his first and so far only apprentice.

Background :
During the early part of her apprenticeship, Andramia had not yet developed her egalitarian view point. She was flippant and generally disrespectful of her master, seeing him as merely a human and not even one of noble birth. At some point the disrespect reached a boiling point. She was giving the task of cleaning every stall, chamber pot, and latrine in the Library. The task was so massive that all she could do every day was take on this chore. There was no time for study and in some cases no time for the midday meal, not that she had much appetite. Normally such a punishment would last a week maybe a little bit longer in order to make a point. In this case it lasted much longer. None of the elven masters would intervene despite her pleading. At first she was angry about being forced to do such menial work but as weeks became months her anger changed first to rage then grief and finally despair. She had no family at this point outside of Maelhaven, she had left her old life behind and it seemed as if her master was trying to run her out of her new home. Eventually she found herself broken and in tears in front of him, wanting to know what it would take to stay. At this point her human master knelt down beside her and wrapped his arms around her. As it turned out the young master was also in tears for having had to go so far with her. The point was to teach her humility, not just to punish her, and also to test her dedication. Due to her focused nature it took longer than expected to make her look to her master for help. After that experience she learned to treat others with respect and she formed a strong bound with her master, although the latter may have taken some time as she did not forgive him for a few years.

The story of her punishment became a tale to future apprentices, something newer apprentices would hear from older ones as either a warning or a joke, the participants of the tale mostly lost among the retelling, although some older masters likely remember.

After her ascension the two continued to work together and developed a close friendship although Andramia still shows a tendency toward deference toward her former master and at times will unconsciously slip into the master/apprentice role with Uri much to the amusement of both of them when it happens

She is well versed in the curse that sits upon Uri and has worked with him to understand it and someday break it

## Monastery Notes:
Tabohr Monastery was built on the edge of the white cliffs that span the western shores of Valwynne. It consists of one large and sturdy stone keep, six stories tall, built directly on the edge of the cliff. Immediately around it there are several smaller single story outbuildings tightly packed with a small courtyard between them. Surrounding all of this is a curtain wall two stories tall with ramparts and four towers — one built on the edge of the cliff on each side of the keep and two more evenly spaced along the walls between. When the keep was originally built, the region was considered remote and untamed so such protection was necessary to protect the monks and the library within. As the town of Maelhaven grew around the monastery, the university was founded immediately outside the monastery walls and eventually surrounded and dwarfed the monastery in terms of occupied land, though none of the university buildings are larger than two stories tall.

Originally, the monastery only consisted of the keep and walls, but as the library within the keep grew, the monks were forced to sacrifice more and more space within the keep to the library. The outbuildings within the walls of the monastery were constructed to house the living quarters, offices, main hall, and recreational spaces of the monks.

The library itself fills the keep quite literally. Shelves line every wall and free-standing shelves fill the space between leaving narrow corridors to move through. All shelves reach floor to ceiling and are well organized but tightly packed. One area, just inside the main entrance on the first floor, contains several long tables for visitors to use while browsing through books.

In the early days of the library, before the University was built, the 6th floor was restricted to the public and held the most dangerous and rare books and scrolls. Over the centuries as the library grew, the University library took responsibility for the more common and mundane tomes as the collection of rare and dangerous material outgrew the 6th floor. And the 5th. And 4th. And 3rd floors as well. Now only the first and second floors of the keep are open to the public, but now even these floors tend to contain the most advanced and rare books. Seekers granted access to the library are always escorted by a monk who assists them in finding what they are looking for and ensures they don’t attempt to enter the restricted floors, don’t use flame for light, and don’t write on or otherwise damage the books within the library.

## Dragon Notes
### First Dragons
At the foundation of Elestel, the gods infused shards of power and manifested them into the mortal world. From them sprung the firstborn beings of the gods, the Great Wyrms, progenitors dragonkind. In the primordial epochs, before man or beast saw its first dawn, these fearsome wyrms formed the world in the wake of their battles, carving out the mountains and filling the seas as they warred. These are their names.

### Creation of the Metallics
Metallic Dragons were created in the same age as the first elves. Which race is older depends on if you ask and elf or dragon. Each of the metallic species were primarily created by a different god. (See MM for personalities p.103) but each god had an influence on the others during the process of creation.

Gold – Vomera, War and Life
Silver – Akilos, Civilization and Sun
Copper – Phaneos, God of the Desert Wastes and the Earth
Bronze – Quzah, God of The Sea, and of Rulers
Brass – Xenne, Goddess of the Sky, Stars, and the Natural World

The most Ancient of dragons (ancient even by the standards of what mortals consider an ancient dragon, rumored to may even be the first dragons) of each color serve as advisers to the gods on matters of the Prime material plane and may for periods of time reside with the gods.

### Metallic Dragon Society
Most metallics live solitary lives (copper being the most solitary), interacting with the world as they each please. They care for their young in pairs but once the young reach adulthood and are capable of taking care of themselves the family units splits. The same dragons may mate multiple time creating a stronger family unit but not all do (this is more common among brass and silver dragons).

While separate; information is still shared and some Dragons have been known to spend their time among the other races in disguise (especially silvers) and have even formed organizations that may never know that there founder was in fact a dragon who returns in other guises over the centuries (more common among golds).

All Dragons have respect for their elders.

In times of trouble that involve peoples, places, or things important to one or more dragons it is common for them to seek out those others with common interest and work in concert to solve a problem. A bronze is most likely to initiate this but all will under the right circumstance

### The Creation of Chromatics
After the gods of good created the first Metallic: Siflene, the goddess of predators took offense at the creation of not just a new predator but the most powerful predator upon the world. She would not allow this challenge to her domain go unanswered. While she is not known for her patience she has the predators ability to stalk and wait for the perfect moment to strike the unwary prey. At some point a new power invaded the realm. She struck a deal with that power, the details of what she offered have been lost to time. With the aide of the newly arrived power she was able to abscond with an egg from each of the dragons. Through the joined powers of these five eggs, the two deities were with provided enough energy of creation that was then shaped into the largest dragon ever known. It was viscous and cunning. Vain and greedy. And highly intelligent. Each of the five heads on this massive dragon was touched by a different element, a corruption of the elements that would have given life to a metallic wyrmling. No dragon like this would ever be seen again for each egg it lay was that of a dragon of one of the five colors of each of its heads.

The first brood of these new dragons was aggressive and jealous. They would attack each other trying to establish dominance. Even those of the same color would attack each other. All of them trying to be the most powerful. These were wild beasts with no loyalty to Siflene but did show respect for the power of the beast that birthed them.

Siflene in her rage at the disloyalty of her creation struck and imprisoned the great beast she created. The power of her blow was enough break off one of the horns was the central red head. With this item Siflene crafted an instrument and imbued it with her power to try and enforce her will on the other dragons. However the power was limited. All dragons (even those of the metallic) could hear it but she was unable to enforce dominance on them. Since then Siflene has looked for a way to take control of not just the chromatic dragons she created but over the metallic dragons as well.
