## Order of Vomera and the Search for Archbishop Leeroy Jenkins
After being controversially raised to the post of Archbishop, Leeroy Jenkins appointed Archpriest Juventus Luppiter as his proxy at the Pinnacle of Light in case he was ever absent. Then, late in the night, Leeroy slipped away from the Pinnacle and rejoined his companions aboard the Arcadia. The Bishops of the Order are panicking and angry to say the least. When it became clear early in the morning that Leeroy was gone, the investigation began in full force. Archpriest Juventus' supposed authority was immediately challenged when he ordered the Bishop's to respect their Archbishop's wishes and end their investigation.

The royal guard at the teleportation circle forced Silvius' group to remain at the circle while Silvius himself was granted an audience with the King to explain himself. Silvius is a practiced politician and attempted to pursuade the King to allow his people to enter the city to wait for Leeroy at the docks. The King, however, distrusts the Order of Vomera and Silvius himself. The King denied their request and ordered them to return immediately to Culverston via the teleportation circle or be arrested for violation of the treaty between their two bodies of power. Silvius reluctantly returned to Culverston where he has begun weaving even more plans to find and recover the wayward Archbishop.
