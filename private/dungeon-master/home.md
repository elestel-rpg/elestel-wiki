# Plots

## The Vengeance of Lua Maan and Gaffabraxis
The minds of Lua Maan and the demon Gaffabraxis have been twisted together by their near-death and unual demonic possession situation. They blame Fenius for abandoning Lua at the Feathergale Spire and for rejecting the Demon (via the warding spell placed upon Fenius by his father).

### Past Activities
* They burned down the Orphanage where Lua and Fenius grew up.
* They stirred up a Young Black Dragon and opened a portal on the Gnome Islands as a trap for the CSC.
* They placed a trap puzzle tower in the streets of Culverston to taunt Fenius with a chance of assassinating him.

## Order of Vomera and the Search for Archbishop Leeroy Jenkins
After being controversially raised to the post of Archbishop, Leeroy Jenkins appointed Archpriest Juventus Luppiter as his proxy at the Pinnacle of Light in case he was ever absent. Then, late in the night, Leeroy slipped away from the Pinnacle and rejoined his companions aboard the Arcadia. The Bishops of the Order are panicking and angry to say the least. When it became clear early in the morning that Leeroy was gone, the investigation began in full force. Archpriest Juventus' supposed authority was immediately challenged when he ordered the Bishop's to respect their Archbishop's wishes and end their investigation. The Bishops rejected that order, claiming Leeroy's elevation of the Archpriest applied only to the normal operations of Pinnacle of Light itself and did not apply to the investigation of the Archbishop's disappearance or to any activities of the Bishops themselves as pertaining to the Order as a whole. 
* By mid-morning the investigation discovered the Arcadia, known to be Leeroy's transport, had left the docks in the night.
* By evening, the investigation had dug up the direction of travel -- up river. 
* Six Bishops led by Silvius Amulius and a small guard retinue immediately took the teleportation circle to the royal palace at Lexgate while Fotios Aris led 4 more bishops and a small contingent of soldiers on a river boat to follow the Arcadia up river.
	* The bad blood between the Order of Vomera and the Kingdom of Cerracan means the Order is not welcome to use the teleportation circle in Lexgate. The royal guard at the teleportation circle forced Silvius' group to remain at the circle while Silvius himself was granted an audience with the King to explain himself. Silvius is a practiced politician and attempted to pursuade the King to allow his people to enter the city to wait for Leeroy at the docks. The King, however, distrusts the Order of Vomera and Silvius himself. The King denied their request and ordered them to return immediately to Culverston via the teleportation circle or be arrested for violation of the treaty between their two bodies of power. Silvius reluctantly returned to Culverston where he has begun weaving even more plans to find and recover the wayward Archbishop.
  * Fotios Aris and his group will arrive at the docks in Lexgate the day after the Arcadia. Two archbishops and half the soldiers will take up watch on the Arcadia while the rest will seek to follow their only lead on where Leeroy might have gone: The Order of the Gauntlet. As bad as the blood is between Cerracan and the Order of Vomera is, the blood between the Orders of Vomera and the Gauntlet is much worse. Instead of approaching the Order of the Gauntlet, Fotios Aris will watch their headquarters hoping to confront Leeroy outside of their walls and insist he return to his duties at the Pinnacle of Light. If Leeroy refuses, they will insist that they be allowed to accompany him in order to protect him on his misguided adventure. If he refuses this too, Fotios will "give up" but in reality will begin coordinating spies to observe Leeroy "for his protection".

## The Cargo Containers of the Arcadia and Her Stranded Crew
Three containers remain undiscovered and unrecovered:
* One crashed at the foot of the Shattered Edge Mountains deep into the cold Feywilds of the north. The entire container shattered in the atmosphere just above the ground, destroying some of its contents and spilling the rest of it in large radius. 
* One crashed east of the Shattered Edge Mountains in the dangerous wilderness north of the Dwarven Empire.
* One crashed deep in the ocean west of the the Northern Continent. It is most likely unrecoverable and few (if anyone) know it even happened.  

## The Machinations of Elaelan Pexalim and the Cult of Zariel
After his betrayal and murder of the Senior Arcanum, Elaelan has kept a low profile, believing his efforts to free Zariel will be better executed if those who may know is allegiences can't stand against him. He has spent 500 years:
* Searching for the Seals holding back Zariel. He doesn't know about Uri's role or involvement in the creation of the Seals.
	* Elaelan has recently uncovered a lead to location of the Seal possessed by the Dwarven Empire. He has shifted to focus his efforts there.
* Searching for the Arcanum. Elaelan believes the Senior Arcanum might have sent some information back to the Arcanum itself, but when word of his betrayal reached them they activated an emergency plan which teleported the entire Arcanum away. It has been hidden and shielded from discovery ever since.
* Cultivating and growing the Cult of Zariel, preparing them to be ready to rise up again when the moment is right.

As the seals weaken, Elaelan can sense his Mistress getting closer to completing her journey to the Prime Material Plan. He knows time grows near and he has begun a campaign to to draw the defenses of the civilized world away from their strongholds and scatter them across the world. When the war comes, he intends to hit those unguarded strongholds fast and hard, taking them before the armies have a chance to return and defend them. To this end he has:

* Sent cult members out in the remote parts of the civilized world to summon Devils to ravage the land and sow chaos.
* When he heard about Demrim, he sought out the Lich who had been defeated there and recruited him to sow his own brand of chaos in exchange for power.


### The Lich of Demrim
Having been defeated by the CSC in Demrim and then again at the ancient battlefield where he raised his second undead army, Vaddon Ashworker now has a personal grudge against the CSC. He has yet to prepare his vengeance.

## The Shadow Council and the Shadow Resistance
The are dumb idiots who will likely play a part again in our story, ignorant of the bad state of the world and thinking their situation is critical when it's just not.
