### Characteristics
**Innocent**
Wrath does not remember his origin. In fact, he doesn't remember much at all past a few days. He is not very smart and can easily be tricked.

**Helpful**
Wrath wants to be useful and thinks whomever holds him must be on is automatically worthy of being attuned to him. He answers all questions quickly, honestly, and to the best of his ability.

**Lonely**
Wrath wants to be interacted with. He'll make up stories about adventures he's had to entertain if it gets him attention. Like a child he can get cranky if ignored but can't hold a grudge because he forgets quickly.

**Bloodthirsty**
He is a sword and is strongly driven to his natural purpose. He does not respect caution or mercy. In combat, he will occassionally attempt to sieze control of his weilder to go on a reckless killing spree. If the weilder regularly refuses to fight or use him in combat, he will attempt to sieze control.
