# Fenius Flameheart
**The Great Transmuto, Fenius Orryn Lythandar Omenwaif Lexipwn Zeddicus Burrowblight Fairbairn Flameheart (GTFOLOLZBFF)**
a.k.a. The Great Transmuto (stage name)
a.k.a. Fen (to his friends)
a.k.a. Lex (his favorite alternate identity)
a.k.a. Burrowblight (what he calls himself as penance for his "accidents")
a.k.a. "Is Something Burning?"


**Background:**
Transmuto was raised by a small gnome family until the age of 10, when his power awakened and destroyed his home. From then until the age of 17, he lived in an orphanage, making a bond of brotherhood with a delusional halfling "wizard", who unwittingly helped him in his schemes to work their peers. On their final day at the orphanage a "mysterious" fire burned the building to the ground. A tragic accident, surely; nothing to do with Transmuto's overzealous arcane experimentation in the dusty orphanage basement, or his mild fascination with fire, or his obsession with mystic power. Despite his past leaving him with a slight distrust of his own magic, Transmuto sought even more arcane power, possibly in an attempt to justify his tainted past. So the pair struck out from the smoldering ruins of their former home to fund their "research". This was done mainly through the loose purses of feckless commoners. After all, everyone knows that if you aren't working the marks you are the mark...

**Flaws:**
* Tends to get lost in contemplation of flickering flames, unless work or an emergency is afoot
* Distrusts his own magic, due to past "accidents", making him prone to "finish the job" in a mundane fashion (for instance, by clubbing the dead bodies left by his magic)
* Prone to ostentation
* Given to megalomania when faced with enemies
