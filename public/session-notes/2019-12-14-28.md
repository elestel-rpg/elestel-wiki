<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of 2019 12/14 and 12/28 -->

* The group continues travel down the tunnels
* Clearly we've moved away from the drow settlements
* We find an area surrounded by stalagmites for cover and sleep
* Through the night spiders descend on the dome
* Casira handles the spiders quickly
* Next morning we continue, finding underground lakes of boiling water and giant stalagmites that cause the path to diverge
* Attacked by more spiders and notice a rumbling of the ground
* Get attacked by a drow caster spider hybrid
* Casira gets dragged underground, Uri follows
* Rest of the group on flying carpet
* Dispatch  the drow/spider
* Find a necklace on her, Fenius IDs and Veralyn takes
* Ground begins to rumble again and more spiders descend
* We make a run away from the spiders
* Fenius creates a wall of stone in the passage
* Some try to climb over before it is sealed
* Rumbling gets louder so we all get quieter
* We see a giant worm pass us by as it burrows through an open area
* We continue down the passages in the direction of the seal
* Leeroy clears a giant mushroom from our path
* We begin moving into an area that is artificial and not natural (remains of a temple)
* Find Lua at an alter casting a spell on the seal
* We try to engage but barriers block
* We begin picking the drow (males) creating the barriers
