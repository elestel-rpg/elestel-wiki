<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of 2019 08 24 -->

* A small group decide to walk around town while the gnomes unload
	* group consists of  Uri, Casira, Veralin, and Leeroy
* Come across a strange building in town called the "Noracath Academy"
	* We see a well dressed wizard acting as a barker and trying to draw a crowd in for a show
* Veralin is curious and convinces the rest of us to go see the show
* We see an entry way with murals and busts (including a mural of the founder)
	* Academy has been absorbed by the University but was founded separately
* Group walks around the entry way and people watches. Leeroy goes exploring
* Group is blinded by a light
	* Group tries to get back together
		* Leeory manages to find Veralin
		* Uri easily finds Casira. Tries to extricate the stubborn Tiefling and fails. Settles for a protective stance
* Large explosion almost kills Veralin and injures the rest
* The group tries to leave and is killed by a "protective" force wall
* RESET
* The group finds itself standing outside the Academy
* The groups spends several loops trying to figure out what is going on and why no one remembers
	* Leeroy investigates much of the Academy and finds someone who has some inclination of the events to come
	* Casira first tries clearing the area then begins looking around
	* Eventually Leeroy determines that a wand of fireballs causes the explosion by holding it when it goes off
	* Eventually we find a hidden room (Uri and Veralin?)
	* Determine it is the machine that is being shown
	* Leeroy manages to open it and survives the security system but triggers the destruction and loop again
	* Casira talks to the head of the Academy and gets her to the machine where she sees the risk 
	* Using a force bead Casira shuts it off and the inventor neutralizes the machine, ending the loop
