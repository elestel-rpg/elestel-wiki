# Session Notes
Where the Adventure Log is a narative-focused record of party travels, these are the raw party notes for each session. Where did the session start? Who went where and why? Who did you encounter, what did you see and learn? Where did the session leave the party? Anything you want to remember for future reference should end up here. Each session should only get one page below for the party to pool their notes. A character's perception, feelings, and plans do _not_ go here as those are subjective and usually private to the character. This is _just the facts._
