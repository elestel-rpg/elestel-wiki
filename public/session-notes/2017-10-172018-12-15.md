<!-- SUBTITLE: Note Compendium of 2017/10/17 through 2018/12/15 -->

October 13<sup>th</sup> 2017
============================

-   Missing Research team consists of 4 elves, 2 dwarves, 3 humans, 1
    gnome

    -   Leader of the team is Aberat (elf)

    -   One Human names Henry

-   After the party finished fighting a group of Duregar, Captain
    Stardust determined that we could no longer communicate with his
    ship.

-   Uri spends some time checking over the area looking at the direction
    of tracks in order to determine where the Duregar came from and what
    the direction the survivor went.

    -   During this Uri noticed that Delg’s boot prints are much larger
        than would be expected. So far that information has not been
        shared

-   The group decides to retreat back closer to the surface and ship in
    order take stock of the presence of Duregar and make plans for being
    out of communication.

-   During the break on the ship Uri notices that Sarya giving greater
    attention to Fubar

-   Uri checks in with Andramia via the communications and asks about
    the relationship of Duregar to Demrim.

    -   The only information that ties the two is that Demrim at its
        deepest may brush up against the Underdark

    -   Uri sets a time table of 10 days without communication

-   During the night it becomes obvious that the ship is struggling
    somewhat with the drain being placed upon it

-   Upon leaving Uri gives Sarya instructions about what to do if
    problems get worse or the group is out of communication for too
    long. She refuses. Uri promises to bring this up with Andramia
    later.

-   Upon returning the Demrim and the site of the scuffle the part finds
    the bodies of the slain are now missing

    -   It is presumed at this time the Duregar removed the bodies

-   Delg notices some fresher foot prints and upon following them
    without the group he finds a Human and former missing member of the
    party, Henry

-   After first scaring him and then scaring him again when the party
    follows and rushes in we provide him with rations and calm him down

    -   He informs us that the he was separate from the party after they
        were taken by undead dwarves.

    -   After much convincing and further scares Henry is sent back up
        to the surface and directed how to get aboard the ship and to
        safety

-   After another encounter with undead this time and some sort of
    flying bug we find the rest of the research team except for a
    missing elf and a gnome. WE talk with the leader of the group Aberat
    (sp?).

-   The group decides that because the two were taken recently it makes
    more sense to follow after the missing members and leave Aberat to
    ascend and contact the ship.

-   As we investigate we leave the building we were in, cross a market
    area, and enter a temple to some unknown dwarven god. As we explore
    the temple we find what looks to be the remains of an alchemists or
    wizards lab. Outside that area we encounter yet more undead.

-   During the fight we notice that Delg has an unnatural reach to his
    fighting

October 27, 2017
================

-   The party takes on the remaining group of undead, learning that
    these things do not always stay dead

-   Uri took a few moments to look around the work area in the back of
    the room. Found a book, a necklace with the symbol of Vomera and two
    small vials (healing potions)

-   The book is written in an ancient form of dwarven

-   Uri find himself unable to understand this ancient variant of
    dwarven

-   Shares the book with Fenius who is also unable to make heads or tail
    of the script

-   Eventually Captain Stardust is able to translate the book which
    turns out to be a journal that belonged to Vaddon Ashworker, Head
    priest of the Temple of Vomera in Demrim

    -   Journal describes a disease the befell Demrim and his works to
        cure it

    -   That the disease resisted Arcane and Clerical powers to cure

    -   The city was sealed as a last ditch effort to quarantine the
        disease

    -   Vaddon Ashworker became obsessed with curing the disease and
        turned to other means of maintaining life after death

-   Recognizing the symbol Uri shared with and reluctantly gave the
    necklace to Leeroy

-   Leeroy felt a warmth from the necklace but was unable to determine
    more

-   The area is determined to be the work area of Vaddon Ashworker and
    where he researched the disease

-   They first follow the trail down, backtracking slightly and
    determine they have been inside the Temple of Demrim.

    -   Characterized by rotted seating and the remains of beautiful
        stain glass windows picturing religious images tied to Vomera

-   The route to surface splits from the trail of the missing
    researchers

-   The party torn between objectives decided to go the surface to try
    and ensure that the researchers that had been rescued stay
    quarantined and to get work via Sarya to Tabhor Monastery of what is
    going on

-   Only Henry made it to the ship the other researchers left and Uri
    lost the trail

-   Delg advocated for going after them because his hometown would
    likely be the first infected since it is the nearest city

-   The party decided to risk going back in for more information, rescue
    the last two researchers and determine the chances of the undead
    spreading over Delg’s and Uri’ caution

-   As the party goes back down after a 90mintue delay go out into the
    city proper and begin moving through the streets.

-   Delg leads, following the trail of the missing researchers

-   The party encounters multiple undead among the houses of Demrim

-   Upon following the trail to the Palace Uri searches around for a
    back entrance while Delg slips in through a broken window

    -   Uri does nto find a back entrance

    -   Delg narrowly misses encountering a few undead

-   The groups slips into the window abandoning attempts at stealth

-   Delg stays back as Uri picks up the trail near the well built and
    still functional front door

-   Do to reckless movements Uri gets jumped moving past the main entray
    room

-   The party dispatches and mvoes into the throne room

-   In the throne room are the two researchers in the throne seats, a
    mechanical device next to it and multiple tables and accoutrements
    for alchemical and medical research. There are multiple undead in
    the room and there is also a much more put together undead which is
    Vaddon Ashwork himself

    -   Captain Stardust puts two shots in him as he attempts to speak

    -   Delg who was staying toward the back casts a fog cloud obscuring
        all manner of sight

    -   Multiple fire balls are thrown into the cloud

    -   The party gets surprised by a wraith which stardust and fubar
        deal with

    -   Uri and Leeroy move into the room

    -   Vaddon drops a swarm of insects injuring most of the party

    -   Fubars rushes through the sward to face Vaddon

    -   Delg drops the cloud after Uri had spent time trying to make his
        way through and deal with the multiple undead in the area

    -   After finishing the few smaller undead and making sure they stay
        dead the party converges on Vaddon

    -   Fubar gets seriously injured

    -   Leeroy finishes off Vaddon with a massive fire bolt

-   Uri searches the area and finds multiple gems, ancient coins, and
    other items amongst the debris of the make shift lab which he scoops
    into his pack.

    -   700 cp, 2000 sp, 1300 gp, 90 pp, Amber (100 gp), 2 x Chrysoberyl
        (100 gp), 2 x Coral (100 gp), Jade (100 gp), Jet (100 gp), Pearl

-   Uri rolls his eyes at both of them and comments that she could do
    better

    -   Andramia first does not catch on to his view of the situation
        and then figures it out and plays along

    -   They discuss the politcal impact of Demrim and that she needs to
        contact the leadership of Valwynn and the dwarves given that the
        plague is still active and the city is open

    -   Andramia teases Uri about his skewed view of time (only Uri and
        Andramia there)

-   The party fully regroups and exchanges knowledge. We discuss wether
    to leave the amulet at teh monastery or take it to the meeting. We
    also talk about making fakes in case others come looking for it and
    we discuss seaking aide.

-   We determine there is not enough time to make fakes, even with
    magical assistance

-   We make our way to the proving grounds to speak to the Master of
    Combat. This isndivdual was not known to any of us.

-   Master of the Order of Combat at Maelhaven Monstery:

    -   Not mentioned but his official title would be Gatekeeper (Uri
        and Fenius would know this)

    -   Dratrin Imrac

    -   Black Dragonborn

    -   Very tall and very thick and very intimadating. Larger than even
        Uri

    -   Wears armor that is dark but contrasts his even darker scales.
        The armor is not plain but has a sharp look to the plates adding
        to the intimadation

    -   He has a no nonsense attitude and brusque but polite

-   We ask for the aid of his order. Uri tries to use his token to apply
    some pressure but is brushed off.

-   After much convincing he agrees to lend us a scout and then brushes
    us off

-   The scout shows and we discuss the plan. He will watch and report to
    Andramia if we get into trouble and if he sees an ambush he will set
    off a flare. He heads off a head of us

    dangerous magic items and want to hir us to retreive one

    deep, unnatural and ANGRY growl and does not stop

    -   Uri knows that this item was once the horn of the original Red
        Dragon and can be used to signal danger to chromatics or summon
        willing chromatics dragons

    -   Charles to provide more lore/backstory on the item likely to
        have been a gift from an evil god

    despite Stardusts best effort to follow the assasin has escaped

-   At teh end of the fight a pissed of Uri decks Malik with a
    gauntleted fist and instills fear in him.

-   Backs Malik to a corner and begins trying to interrogate him

-   Stardust steps in as Malik shakes off the fear

-   Malik is Malik Torgar, a minor noble

-   Talks about the "Show Resistance" and the "Shadow Council" which is
    a group a nobles and the wealthy that gather items of power and
    manipulates politics and society toward their own ends

-   Assasin was likely Alilynn Darkeyes and works for the "Shadow
    Council"

-   Uri thinks this is a bunch of Lordlings playing at things but will
    go along to deal with the Draakhorn which all have agreed to turn
    over to the monastery at this point

-   We take to conversation to the ship where Stardust tries to use the
    medical equipment on the captured soldier (Delg captured at the end
    of the fight) but he suicides. Stardust still collects some scans

    moved from the excavation side where Malik's people saw it to
    Uthadar's estate in Egley on the west coast of the continent

    restricted section of the library with a fuck with me at your own
    risk attitude.

    -   Determines that it summons Chromatic Dragons

    -   Only the Cult of The Dragon knows how to make it work

    section where Uri is working

    -   They find URi at a table with a pile of books

-   Uri precedes to fill the group in on the nature of Dragons, mostly
    talking about Chromatic Wyrms variety but also lectures a bit on
    Metallic

    -   Uri uses multiple epithets when describing them

-   Both Stardust and Fenius try to steal the non-magical dwarven glow
    stones

    -   Both are caught (Fenius easily)

-   Fenius tries to steal two more books but does not make it out

    Gnomish and Human societies for Stardust as well as star charts and
    a map that includes Egley (location of the Draakhorn)

    -   Uri also requests a book on the Celestial language

-   Stardust requests some simple (understood as children's) books on
    the world

-   After the party divides for bed:

    -   Stardust goes to talk to Sarya and offers her a place on the
        ship if she wants to leave the Monastery. Offers her an encoded
        weapon

    -   Uri talks with Andramia about Sarya and the groups need of her
        assistance. That she is bright and the research she would do on
        the ship could easily earn her a Master's ranks. That she needs
        to listen for everyone's safety.

        -   Uri suggests that he take her on as an apprentice and
            mentions that his last apprentice turned out well

        -   Uri asks about discipline which Andramia reminds him that
            she has a different style

    -   Uri then goes to talk to Sarya, passing Stardust leaving the
        apprentice quarters

        -   Talks to her about coming with them as his apprentice

        -   Goes over why he expects here to listen and that lives may
            depend on her doing what she is told, hers and others

        -   Mentions that the work on the ship could easily provide the
            novel research and addition to the library's store of
            knowledge that would qualify her for Master and mentions
            that this area could result in a whole new order

-   That morning Uri is awakened by a dark green Tiefling who turns out
    to be Carric

    -   Uri informs him of their ability to travel rapidly and that they
        will leave after breakfast

-   The next day Uri picks up the books

-   At the same time Stardust and Fenius con teh quartermaster out of
    supplies using a masterful forgery of Uri's monastery chop

    -   Quartermaster informs them that on such short notice he can only
        get some of the requested material

-   Uri goes to the quartermaster asking for supplies, upon hearing
    about the other request in his name informas the quartermaster that
    only he and Sarya Glynlee can requisition supplies in his name.
    Reduces the requested supplies to a reasonable amount, including
    supplies specifically for Sarya to be on extended leave

    -   As an afterthought Uri suggests having Gatekeeper Imrac's men
        deal with Fenius or Stardust if they try to con more supplies

    the ship squared away

    -   each established their own quarters

    -   Sarya began recruiting help for the shipping including Petro

-   We stop at various ports along the coast to resupply the ship and
    collect material for repairs

        Alchemists in Egley and the Potion of Frost Giant Strength
        Stardust stole from a shop. Stardust and Uri manage to sell the
        potions for a very good price

    the language of Stardust (Celestial)

-   We review items found in the Manor, most are just curiosities but
    two rings stand out

    -   1 gold and 1 silver ring that interact with each other. The gold
        ring offers protection and the silver enhances strength

        horn is secured and she agrees

    on duty again at the entrance.

-   After we get some additional Monastery guards we enter the first
    level and the door is locked behind us by Willum he joins us

    required to open

    -   second level is a hallway with multiple locked vaults

-   When entering the third level it takes Andramia, Willum and Uri to
    unlock

-   WIllum insists on everyone but Uri, Andramia, and himself stay
    (Sarya stayed on level 1)

-   Starsut convinces Andramia to let him join. Uri fails to get Fenius
    access

    -   Willum makes sure Fenius has a new "best friend" for while he's
        gone

-   Uri realizes we're storing this on level 3 which peaks his interest
    as to what could be on the top floor given the level of danger we
    are currently dealing with

    thinking no time has passed

    -   Stardust starting the slightly annoy Andramia with his
        flirting(?)/charms

    which after Uri no resisting prompts Andramia to do the same

    -   questions are asked in order to ascertain that Andramia is not a
        memerb of either of the shadow groups we have dealt with

    -   No questions are asked about possible influence by either group

    -   No questions are asked of Uri

-   We find out that Malik Torgar was a lay about and generally useless
    until his father passed and he got his act together

    -   Andramia agreed to meet with him to provide assurance that the
        horn is secure so that we can get the rest of our payment

-   The group goes shopping for equipment

    more potent than he or Fenius have ever used

    happened

-   Leeroy beseeches Vomera's aide to remove a curse but cannot because
    Uri is not cursed

-   It is explained that what is wrong with Uri is a fractured
    attunement. Something that can happen when the process of attuning a
    magic item goes wrong

    -   This is potentially lethal

    -   The group discusses options such as trying to let the attunement
        finish but this is cautioned because the ring is dangerous and
        may require both making it even more dangerous

    understands

-   Leeroy casts tongues and what he hears is disoriented and frightened

-   Stardust talks to the Tyrant and upon conversations with Uri and the
    Tyran, aided by Stardust determine it is holding and guarding the
    seal we are after

-   Confirms that the seal is keeping Zariel out of the prime material

-   Uri tries to bargain for a passage out as we all want the same
    thing, to keep the seal safe and is willing to leave it with the
    Tyrant

    Uri is in fact a dragon several rounds of questioning occurred.
    Eventually under the aegis of a zone of truth

    the sun rose

-   Leeroy still counting days until his armor is ready

    -   we determined two were missing: Arlet (caravan mistress) and
        Toley (the performer)

-   Casira finds indication of fiendish activity

-   The group decides not to follow but rather leave

-   Everyone but Uri takes their rest as the day goes on

-   Eventually Uri starts feeling the signs of exhaustion and passes the
    helm to a now rested Stardust

    were exploring the desert

    -   Incubus, goat things and a larger devil

    -   Uri picks up 2 more potions and a quality map of the area up
        river

    Toley is, he ran a different direction

    truth

-   We try to explain to guards that she may have ties to a fiends

-   We decide to go peacefully to answer questions

November 17, 2018
=================

-   As the guards approach and begin to move us toward the local
    constabulary offices Stardust uses minor illusion to mimic a scream

-   One guard sees and not knowing what it was tries to counterspell

    -   Fenius counters the counterspell

    followed by Stardust and Fenius casting invisibility on the party

    it is not Sr)

    quality ale after everyone has a laugh

    -   Still has not told anyone

-   Stardust tries to make other deals at the docks for items to
    transport and sell

-   Meets a shady figure wanting goods transported/smuggled (weapons)

    attacked by archers

    make a deal with

-   Uri goes to the Infirmary and meets up with Fenius and Sarya

-   Meet Chuna (male bronze dragonborn)

    -   He's the ships healer

-   We determine that the seal is leaking energy and it gets worse in
    proximity to Uri

-   No real idea how it functions but decide best to keep away from Uri

        Zariel
