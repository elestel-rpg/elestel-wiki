## real notes

NPCs: `Vulas (brother), Lilandra (sister in law), Amara (niece), Corril (Lilly's Uncle), "The Mother"`

* Arch Bishop Leeroy and his squire take off into the woods for "training," leaving the party short it's primary healer.
* Party wakes to discover that Uri has left the ship as well to find someone he's been searching for "for a long time." 
* Fenius researches the flake of Uri's sword. Determines that the sword is probably not cursed, though the magic has left the flake.
* Corril comes to the ship asking after Casira, saying there is a family emergency. Jubjub messes with him a bit, until Carril looks for someone else to help him.
* Fenius encounters Corril and finds his story suspicious; he immediately subjects him to "tests" that Corril doesn't understand, such as scans in the ship's lab (the readings of which Fenius misinterprests as even more suspicious), and forcing him to play the Xbox (in order to see if he is similarly susceptabel to its enchantments as the Arch Bishop).
* Sarya pulls Corril away from Fenius's tests and guides him to Casira, who learns that Lilandra and Amara are missing and may have been harmed, as their wagon was found abandoned in the Fae Wild.
* Suspicious of the coincidence of Uri's sudden departure and Corril's just happening to "find" the ship, Fenius agrees to help hunt down Casira's relatives.
* The party, along with Corril, find evidence of corruption along the trail to the abandoned wagon. When the wagon is found, it is a smoking ruin, and there is clear evidence of a battle between fiends and woodland creatures. Dryad tracks are found leading away from the site. The party follows, Casira leading the way.
* Deeper in the forest, the party is ambushed by a group of fiends. Battle ensues, but the party prevails, banishing a devil and slaughtering the others.
* A wounded dryad is encountered when she tries to entangle us in vegitation, suspecting that we are enemies. Casira speaks Sylvan to her, convinces her that the party is allied iwth her cause.
* Dryad leads party to "The Mother", and Arch Druid who is protecting Casira's family.
* Fenius is disgusted to find children playing with cooperative squirrels and further mortified when Jubjub joins in.
* Casira is heartened at the care given to her family and reveals to The Mother the situation regarding the seals and the connection to the ancient war. The Mother offers to keep Casira's family safe while training Lilandra. She also offers her long-dead sister's magical wrappings to Trixie, increasing the Tabaxi's martial prowess.
* Fenius, itching to leave, nearly pulls the party from The Mother's abode and sets up camp far enough away to avoid the tree hugger's oppressive pall of cuteness.
