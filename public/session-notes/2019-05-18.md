* Arch Bishop Leeroy and his squire take off into the woods for "training," leaving the party short it's primary healer.
* Party wakes to discover that Uri has left the ship as well to find someone he's been searching for "for a long time." 
* Gasket is tailing Uri, since the familiar was put on "Uri watch" following the sword's reaction to being studied.
* Fenius researches the flake of Uri's sword. Determines that the sword is probably cursed. Fenius, familiar with the scenario by now, prepares *Hold Person* and *Remove Curse* before the party goes after the wayward dragon.
* The party uses Gasket and Casira's dragon sense to triangulate Uri's location.
* Party fights a pack of 3 hell hounds and another devil of undetermined nature. Party manages to win with only minor injuries.
* Party finds Uri giving his blood to a woman that Fenius determines is a witch. Fenius throws *Hold Person* on Uri while the others attack the witch.
* Fenius ties up Uri, release *Hold Person*, and helps the others subdue the witch, while Uri repeatedly yells for us to stop. Party knocks out both Uri and the witch, binding and gagging both. Fenius removes a crystal focus that feels tainted with devil magic. 
* Fenius casts *Sending* to coordinate a meetup with Leeroy in prep for interrogation.
