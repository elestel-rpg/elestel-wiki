After our match Uri goes up to watch a few other matches to scout out possible competition
Afterward scout out the bizarre before heading to the ship
Casira is following Uri
Casira and Uri talk about his behavior
Uri picks up something off with Casira. She does not act like the other "children" he is used to dealing with but cannot put his finger on it. More confidence or used to being shown deference maybe?
