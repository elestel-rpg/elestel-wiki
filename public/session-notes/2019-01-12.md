Fenius and Stardust go to purchase alchemical and other laboratory supplies
Stardust disguised as Uri and makes fool of himself
Leeroy goes to the Pinnacle and is invited to dinner by the old priest
Uri, Stardust and Fen begin doing some research
Determine Uri's power is being used to power the seals
Sarya joins the party for dinner
