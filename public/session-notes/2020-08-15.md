# Trolled

* Party comes upon a pair of dragonborn being attacked by a spirit troll. Soon, it is joined by a rot troll. Once the rot troll is destroyed, another spirit troll comes into the fray, and the first spirit troll regens. After killing the trolls, the two dragonborns thank us, but warn us away from their camp.
* The detector points in the general direction of the dragonborn camp, so the Party follows the pair at a distance.
* The Party stealths and discovers that the compass is pointing directly toward the "camp" mentioned by the dragonborn, which is really a fort, even when they skirt the fort.
* Uri scries on Gojira. Gojira is in the fort, and he is ordering other dragonborn to "find the party in the woods!"
