<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Rore -->

Rore is a small city located along the western foothills of the Shattered Edge Mountains. Very little is known about Rore to outsiders and it is rarely even listed on maps. The town is surrounded by densely wooded areas littered with caves. This region is known to be heavily populated by goblinoids and most travelers are cautious when traversing the area. Even though Rore is a humanoid town it seems to flourish regardless of the goblinoid population.
