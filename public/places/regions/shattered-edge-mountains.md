# The Shattered Edge Mountains
The Shattered Edge Mountains are a massive and forbidding mountain range that runs for over a thousand miles along the eastern side of the land from the northern sea to the southern sea. In the middle it connects the two continents with the Sea of Arcanis on itâ€™s western shores. The mountains are completely impassable in most places. To travel from one side to the other, most people find the long way by ship to be the most equitable for trade while the Dwarves to the east maintain a chain of tunnels.
