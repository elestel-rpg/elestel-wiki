# Valwynne
Valwynne is the name of both the large island at the center of the Sea of Arcanis and the country that inhabits it. It’s capital city is Maelhaven. It was originally a relatively small Elven nation but it’s central position in the world made it a crossroads of trade and commerce. As the The University grew famous and Maelhaven with it, Valwynne also became a destination in it’s own right. These days, Valwynne is a melting pot of races, religions, and cultures with the original Elves no longer in the majority.
