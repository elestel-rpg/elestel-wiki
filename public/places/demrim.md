<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Demrim -->

History:
Little is known about the ancient Dwarven city of Demrim. Many believe it to be fictional, and the stories about it vary wildly. Among scholars most believe it to be real, but It is not thought to have been a particularly big or important city, but It’s sudden disappearance 3100 years ago has had many people searching for it and speculating about it’s fate. Knowledge of its location in the world has long since been lost, though rumors suggest the Dwarves of the eastern kingdoms know and aren’t telling. Finding it is considered by many to be one of the greatest archaeological aspirations.

Currently:
The site of the city may have been discovered by a research team under the auspices of Andramia Elsinire from the Tabohr Monastery. Currently the team is missing with no clue as to what happened.
