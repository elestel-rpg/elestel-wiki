<!-- TITLE: Order of Nature -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Order of Nature -->

This group studies the natural world and the inner workings of nature. This is the order most likely to include druidic studies and Druids as members as well as academics and other students of the natural order. This group often works closely with the University for research purposes but unlike Arcanum it does not often teach but instead recruits druid apprentices from the University

Name: Trimmeon Locke
Race: Elf
Title: Guardian of Circles, The Guardian

A rough elf, master of the druidic path, Guardian Locke appears to be of early middle years, though the perfection of his art weakens the accuracy of any such estimation. He brooks no foolishness from others, and is like to spend time with the beasts of the forests as with his fellows. Such is his connection with nature that he sees little point in separating the halls of the Monastery and University from the public. He pushes to open up the cloistered nature of the institutions he serves within, and can often be seen favoring homeless waifs at the expense of his stuffier colleagues — when he can be bothered to keep their company at all.

In addition to leading the Order of Nature in the Monastery, the druids of the region follow his lead in many ways, seeing him as a store of nature’s wisdom, This adds to the influence over the workings of the Monastery that he can wield. As a bloc, the druids have a great deal to offer anyone who they would ally with, so the Guardian is respected even as he is only barely tolerated by some. He provides a bridge between Nature and Civilization among the Orders of the Monastery. Many of the younger students favor him for his plain speech and openness. More than a few times has he looped students and apprentices into helping him dress a carcass in the Monastery courtyard, while leading a whole troop of them in giving thanks to the spirit of the animal — often while the older practitioners look on in distaste.

Guardian Locke has been known to burst in on meetings of the other masters, fresh from the field, unwashed and uncaring, baiting the underestimation of his opponents in the political life of the Monastery. More often than some like to admit, such tactics work in his favor.
