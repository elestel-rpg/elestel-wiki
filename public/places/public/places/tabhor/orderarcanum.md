Name: Aethelion Moonspar (nick name “Leo”)
Race: Elf
Title: Magisterum

Magisterum Moonspar is an ancient elf, old even for his long-lived kind. He saw the founding of the Monastery and sought to brings its works to a good ends through his guidance over the centuries. His gentle path of Telling the Weave has aided the both the Monastery and the University through troubled times uncountable. He has a way of “showing up” just when a calm and good-natured presence would be most useful.

Magisterum Moonspar has a habit of walking around as if of lower station, and often catches the unschooled and unsuspecting in their natural turn of business. He dislikes holding his position over others, unless the time is right, but will often help others in from the shadows, not seeking credit. More than one matter of Monastery intrigue has fallen to his timely intervention.

He has a revere garden where he takes his rest. If any intrude during these times, they might hear an ethereal tune emanating from around him, as if the very air is singing. The garden is a collection of both rare and common herbs and spices from around Elestel, interspersed with more common plants, trees, and shrubs.

Peaceful as the Magisterum’s garden is, it holds a dark history. His daughter, Elsebeth, was assassinated among its greenery. In addition, some of the mystic flora are so rare and dangerous, that they were procured at great risk — and sometimes great loss. The Magisterum keeps his own council on such missions, but he plays a hand in securing items of power, helping to keep them out of the wrong hands. He rarely goes on such missions himself anymore, but will occasionally offer guidance, advice, lore, or even help persuade those who might effect such endeavors.
