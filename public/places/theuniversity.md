<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Theuniversity -->

The University, known the world over simply as The University, sits at the heart of the city of Maelhaven in Valwynne. As the town supporting Tabohr Monastery grew into a city, the University was formed to serve its growing population. Over time the University grew to surround and ultimately dwarf the old monastery.

The University serves as both a center for learning and as an extension of the Monastery library, housing the most commonly used tombs. Access to the University library is free and open to all but is carefully controlled and monitored. Enrollment in the University is also open to all, but due to limited space only so many new students are allowed each year. In order to promote equal access to all, tuition fees are set based on merit and wealth, favoring the gifted and the poor, but never so expensive as to be out of reach to those who truly wish to learn.

Most subjects taught in the University are of the mundane and practical variety, but students can study pretty much any subject within its walls including the arcane arts if one has the spark for it.
