<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Tabhor Monastery -->

Tabohr Monastery is located at the heart of The University in Maelhaven and is the oldest structure in the city. The Monastery, originally founded long ago by the Elven monks that inhabited the region, is still in use today by the monks who built it. Though the monks were originally exclusively Elves, as the city and country around the monastery has grown into a melting pot, so too has the order of monks. The primary mission of the monks is the maintenance and growth of its famous library. As the library’s collection of books and scrolls have grown to fill the space within the monastery walls, the University surrounding the Monastery has provided additional space for the expanded library. The monks have little to do with the University itself, but they run and control the library within it. The University library houses the most commonly used tombs while the Monastery itself holds the rarer, more valuable, and more dangerous books. As such, entrance into the Monastery library is heavily restricted. Those who manage to gain entrance have limited access and are carefully monitored.

The monastery consists of 6 Orders each with different responsibilities toward the Library:
[Order of Arcanum](public/places/tabhormonastery/order_arcanum)
