<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Kisara -->

### Appearance
A young human woman of slender build and brown hair. Her msot noticeable feature is that of a long scar running the length of her right arm

### Identity
Kisara is the sister to Uri. Both are Ancient Brass Dragons that are forced into human form as a result or by product of Uri's transformation. Where Uri is gruff and abrasive, Kisara is kind and welcoming. She runs an Inn in a small town a few days from Lexgate and is pushing the length of time she can stay there before people wonder about her not agining.

The scar on her arm is a manifestation of an injury she took during the war. While running messages her wing was severely damaged.

The siblings have not had contact since Uri was transformed.
