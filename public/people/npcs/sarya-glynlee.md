Background:

Sarya Glynlee, Wood Elf of Aendrilad, approached the front steps of The University, the Beacon of Maelhaven. Her aching feet forgotten, she gazed wide eyed with wonder at of the possibilities that lay before her. She had traveled so long, endured so much to get here. She didn’t waste a second as she rushed up the steps and into the admissions office.

“I’m sorry, child, there’s nothing I can do. We don’t accept new students in the middle of the term without full tuition up front. What you have, sadly, is not nearly enough.” The aged gnome’s sympathetic smile stabbed like a hot knife into Sarya’s heart from behind weary, bespectacled eyes. She quickly scratched at a piece of paper with a quill and handed Sarya the paper. “We’ll start accepting applications for the next term on this date. You seem like a bright girl. If you show up early on that day, I think you’ll have a really good chance at getting a spot in our Opportunity Scholarship for the Disadvantaged.”

Hours later, eyes puffy and heart bereft of the hope that had fueled her journey to Maelhaven, Sarya found herself walking through the doors of the famous Tabohr Monastery. This keep at the center of the University was the ancient foundation upon which the University had been established. She expected to be turned away as she walked past the front desk but, to her surprise, the elven man behind the counter only nodded to her as she passed. So here, at least, what she’d been told was true. The library truly is open to all.

She walked slowly up and down the cramped and endless aisles taking in the dusty aroma of old tomes and the steady white light of the drift globes. Her fingers dragged along the spines of the books and read their titles, but she could not bear to take a book off the shelf. She had gotten so close to realizing her dream of enrolling in the university and yet it never felt so distant as it did now. What was she going to do?

At age 26, Sarya was far from an adult when she had taken every coin she’d ever saved and abandoned her family to pursue this dream. They’d never have let her go if they’d known. She’d spent most of that money just getting here on the promise of a free education, but now she didn’t have enough left to last the rest of the month, let alone the three months until the next term. And, of course, most of her money gone she wouldn’t have enough to make a return trip home; not that she would ever consider that option. She’d come too far to give up now. Her resolve hardened as she began to think through the problem again from the beginning.

Andramia Elsinire, Monk and Master of Field Research and Recovery of the Tabohr Monastery, sat alone in the early morning shade of the Monastery. She read a book in one had while she enjoyed her breakfast from the other. Today’s subject: The Unnamed God. She considered the page she’d just read as she took another bite of sweet fruit. Little was known about this secretive deity. Worshipers of the Unnamed numbered far fewer than the other gods, but her (or his? No one really knew) fingerprint on the world was undeniable. Still, most scholars agreed on one thing: The Unnamed was like a puzzle piece that just didn’t fit.

As Andramia took her final bite, she replaced her bookmark and stood up to start her day. As she approached the keep’s locked front door, she was not surprised to see the young wood elf girl waiting to be let in. This was what, the third day in a row they’d met like this? The girl would spend all day within the walls of the library, Andramia knew, and would only leave when forced to at the end of public hours.

She looked the girl up and down, noticing for the first time the way the girl was dressed; judging from the garments, she was not a girl of wealth or poverty, but the cut of the dress indicated she was not of Valwynne. Furthermore, the clothes looked worn and dirtier than the should be. This gave Andramia pause. “What’s your name, young one?” she asked finally as she finished unlocking the door.

“Sarya, Mistress,” the girl replied.

“Around here we don’t make gender distinctions with our titles. You may call me Master Andramia. If you don’t mind my asking, what brings you to our library so early every day? Don’t you have school to attend in the city?”

Sarya looked down and hesitated before answering. “No, Master Andramia.” Andramia waited for Sarya to continue, but the girl just walked into the keep behind her and began to disappear into the stacks as she did every morning.

“Sarya… where are your parents?”

Three weeks later Sarya stood to file out of her Arcane Applications of Calculus class to see Master Andramia waiting for her at the door.

“I hear from your instructors that you are surpassing all expectations,” the Master of the Monastery said as Sarya joined her at the door.

“It’s not so hard. I already learned most of this stuff from the books in the community collective back home.” Sarya replied. She didn’t know how to behave around this woman, who had unexpectedly funded and endorsed Sarya’s early admittance into The University. She was grateful beyond belief, but still couldn’t understand such generosity.

“When I was just an initiate here at the Monastery, my Master once told me that I would take my own pupil some day. Most other initiates were afraid of Master Uri but on that day I told him to his face that he was crazy. At the time I thought he was an overly strict master with unreasonably high expectations, but I was young and didn’t know what I wanted from the world. Now, as I look back, I understand. He said he saw potential in me and demanded from me only what he knew I could achieve.”

They walked down the halls of The University together but Sarya remained silent as the the elder woman spoke.

“I tell you this because I see great potential in you as well. The University will take you a long way, Sarya, but I believe you can do better. If you are willing, I’d like to take you on as my apprentice.” Sarya stopped and looked up at the monk, confused. After a moment, Master Andramia continued. “You will continue your studies here at The University, of course, but if you accept my invitation you will spend your time outside class with me. Like my master did of me, I will expect your best. But, if you are up to the challenge, I will help you reach your full potential.”

Several moments passed as they stood in silence, the hallways around them emptying slowly as the next set of classes began. Sarya was so stunned she didn’t know what to say. Master Andramia opened her mouth to continue speaking but before she could say anything, Sarya heard herself say, “I accept.” She had spent so many years dreaming of The University, claustrophobic in her ignorance and desperate to learn all she could, but never had anyone in her life supported this dream. Her people were happy in their ignorance and preferred to live a life of isolation in tropical forests of the Southern Wilds, but not Sarya. Elestel called to her and and today Sarya knew she took her first step on her true journey. With Master Andramia’s help she would learn everything she could here at The University and Tabohr Monastery. After that, who knows… many monks of the monastery, she knew, travelled the world in search of knowledge. That life called to Sarya and she would answer.
