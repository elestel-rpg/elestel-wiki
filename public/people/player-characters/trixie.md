<!-- TITLE: A cat gets a name-->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Trixie -->

Inside the hull of the Arcadia sits a small cargo container designed for transporting individuals placed in cryostasis. A group of the space pirate crew is gathered around inspecting the damage that was done during raid earlier that day on a overly guarded cargo ship. Most of the tubes look damaged and empty, but one looks damaged and indicating that the adrenal pump has been activated to awaken the individual due to an emergency rethaw process being initiated. 

The pod opens with a hiss, a humanoid shape leaps out and begins clawing and tearing at the 3 assembled crew members unfortunate enough to be gathered around. As the humanoid creature stops to pant and breathe from the exertion, a voice calls out.

“Was that really necessary?”

The creature looked up and spits a mouthful of blood out, then wiped her maw with the back of a blood covered hand. The movement only served to smear blood around her feline mouth. The creature’s eyes narrowed noticing the blaster pistol and battle armor the remaining pirate is wearing.

“Look, this can go a few ways.” The man said, while scratching at his temple and taking note of the damage done to the crew members. “We can settle this down and talk, or one of us is either going to be dead or wounded. I’m not a huge fan of the latter.” 

“Where am I?” The strange tiger like humanoid said with a guttural growl, while feeling the tingling effects of what must have been the chemicals from the adrenal pump starting to wear off.

“You’re on the Arcadia… a… pir..” The man hesitated. “a ship… that happened to find a freighter that was in need of some assistance with their cargo.”

He studied her carefully, noticing the strange animalistic features. It was as if someone had turned one of those large cat things from the story books into a person. Her fur was mostly orange with black striping across it, creating a pattern that fed into itself. Her hands looked human, but in place of regular finger nails black claws were extended and dripping with blood from the fallen men at her feet. She wore a small bracelet on her wrist that bore some markings that he couldn’t quite make out at this distance.

“But where am I? And who the hell are you and these… bodies.” She said as the drugs continued to leave her system and the rage subsided to a level that was more manageable.

“Those unfortunate lot were members of our crew. Brigs was a bit of a bastard and owed me a few hundred credits, so I’m probably not going to get that back… Jax was mostly a loner and didn’t really get into too much mischief outside the norm. And the one who’s throat you graciously ripped out is Kal’lik… he… well, let’s just say there will be a lot of brothels across the galaxy that will probably light candles for their lost revenue… I’m Janith, or Stardust if you use my call sign… which most people around here do. Now that that’s out of the way, who are you and what were you doing being shipped through contested space lanes?”

“I… I don’t have a name… I’m… I…” she stammered as the drugs swirled through her system leaving her dazed and lethargic. “I was being deployed for a mission… I hadn’t received orders yet…”

Stardust cocked an eyebrow. “Mission, eh? What exactly are you?”

She glowered as she wobbled into a fighting stance. “I’m a terrorshade… and you’re about to.. about to…” She fainted.

Stardust moved in quickly and caught her noting the time it took for his tranquilizer dart to take effect. “That is an impressive resistance… that was enough of a dose to take down a 200 kg man in 3 seconds typically…” he thought as he gently lowered her to a patch of ground that wasn’t covered in blood.

He walked to the wall and pushed a button. “Cleanup in Cargo Bay 4… we’re going to also need to pick up a few new recruits on our next stop… these guys… let’s just say we won’t have to worry about them complaining about their shares…”

Stardust loaded the strange tiger human onto a skiff. He took a closer look at the bracelet that she was wearing, engraved was ‘3-6-EE’. “Three – six - EE… must be some ID number” he pondered as he began pushing the cart towards one of the freshly empty crew rooms.

Once in the room, Stardust began gently cleaning the blood and gore from the matted hair. Careful to pay attention to the clock and make sure that he wasn’t too close when she might awaken. When she finally didn’t look like she had just freshly killed three people, Stardust utilized the replicator in the room to create some basic food and drink. He had read that typically when coming out of a cryostasis the body is starving. Having staged the room in such a way as to have a quick exit if needed and objects in the path of this animal like creature, Stardust waited for the tranquilizer to run its course.

Her eyes fluttered. The smell of some sort of stew filled her nostrils as she blearily looked around her surroundings. She was in a room that was no bigger than 10’ x 10’. She was laying with her head slightly propped up in a bed. A soft bed compared to what she was used to. She looked at the bowl sitting directly in front of her eyes and grabbed at it and began eating without even pausing to look for a fork or spoon.

“That’s better isn’t it?” The voice caused her ear to twitch, but her mouth continued chewing. “Now that we’re out of that mess, we can start working on figuring out some other questions that I think we both have.”

He could hear the slight growl in her throat as she emptied the bowl. He deftly placed a second bowl in front of her that he had prepared just in case.

“You’ve got a bracelet on that says 3-6-EE, I’m guessing that’s some sort of identifier… seems a bit impersonal… what if we called you tri-six? Hmmm, that doesn’t really roll off the tongue well does it… What about Trixie?”

She stopped chewing… “Did you… Did you just… Do I have a name?”

A sly smile formed on his lips. “If my humble attempt to make conversation around what little I know about you means you have a name… then I believe you do.”

She couldn’t contain herself and leapt over the table and knocked him to the floor.

“I HAVE A NAME!!!” She hugged him tightly. “I HAVE A NAME!!!”

“I have a spine… or had one…” He said while trying to get his breath. “I don’t suppose you can… so kindly let me up?”

“Oh… sorry… I was just… excited… I’ve never had a name… Trixie… I’m Trixie…” She purred as she got up and sat back on the bed and started eating again.

“Yeah…” he said picking up the chair and rubbing the back of his head… “You’re very Trixie…”

Claxons began to blare.

“Shit… I should have known… you said you were some sort of terror something or other… so those bastards in Omegacorp probably want you back…” He said as he headed toward the door.

“I… I don’t want to go back… I…” She stammered.

“I can’t promise anything… but I’ve got to get us out of here now… stay put here and you should be ok.”

Stardust left the room as the lights on the ship changed to red indicating battle stations.

She waited listening to the sounds of the hull rumbling with the sounds of impacts to the outer shields protected any real damage from occurring to the ship. It seemed like a siege for hours, but was really just a few moments.

The speaker on the wall crackled to life. “Trix, I’m about to jump us to hyperspace… You’ve got about 30 seconds to get to the closest escape pod and buckle in, I’ve lit the way. Follow the blue line and strap yourself in… And Trixie, no matter what happens, it was nice to meet you.”

A blue line appeared at the edge of the door frame. Trixie pushed herself up and dashed in the direction it indicated. After a quick turn around the corner, a hatch was open with what looked like a chair with straps. The feeling of dread raised in the back of her head as memories of being strapped to similar devices flooded into memory. Would he lie to her? What was the game here? Were there any other options? She quickly pushed down doubt as a hum began to reverberate throughout the ship. She quickly buckled herself in, noticing that there were buttons she could push to unstrap herself, and none of the straps seemed to restrain her like in the lab.


Trixie watched as the distant ship shape faded from view as the small container she was in hurled toward the planet below. She wasn’t sure what had happened, but at some point there was the sounds of people screaming and the shuttering of the ship, then the hatch had closed and a timer started ticking. She hit the big red button that was flashing and the next thing she knew she was flying through space. What had happened? Where was she? There were so many questions and no one to ask.

The madness of the situation wasn’t lost on her. At least now, she had a name.


The landing was rough. It wasn’t so much a landing as a crash that Trixie was able to walk away from. The pod didn’t look like it had much of anything of salvageable, there was a small survival kit with some protein bars and water packets along with some basic things like a universal translator. Even in the darkness of night, her feline like eyes were able to make out most everything that was of use.

“Well… at least I’m alive. I wonder what happened… I wonder if he is ok…” She muttered to herself as she hefted the small pack with supplies on her back.

Which direction though? She saw some lights far off in the distance. They were strange though, they flickered more than the steady lights she was used to. She watched as what looked like streaks of light flared through the night sky far away from her. Was that the ship she was just on, breaking into pieces and burning up on reentry? What about the crew? What about him? She sighed heavily.


She had been walking towards the lights for what felt like hours, the sun was starting to rise in the sky and she saw what looked like stone walls rising in the distance.


“Summon the mistress… she’s going to want to see this…” A guard said to one of the runners who was busy polishing boots.
“Really? You want me to bug her before she’s probably had first meal?” The pugnacious youth said.
“You’ll fetch her or I’ll box your ears you ungrateful little churl.” The guard bellowed as he flung a small pebble at the boy. The boy took off running in the direction of the massive complex.
