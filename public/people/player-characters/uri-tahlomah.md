## History (Work in Progress)
### Transformation
A man in appearance, what lies beneath is the knowledge, history, drive and heart of the noblest beings on Elestel; a dragon. Uri has been trapped in the form of a human for over 400 years and is currently working on understanding the transformation. What he currently understands is that at some point toward the end of the last great war he volunteered to be used in a ritual to seal the Lord of Avernus,  Archdevil Zariel, away from the prime material plane. The result of the spell was the creation of physical seals and his seemingly permanent transformation into a human. Due to an event that happened shortly after the tansformation, Uri has found his memories around that time scrambled or lost, including why he was stuck in the form of a human.

### Post Transformation
After Uri's memories were scrambled he spent a period of about 50 or so years learning to live in non-draconic society in Maelhaven. First begging then gaining work doing manual labor. Ultimately taking on work in the city watch and then as a private guard in the Gilded City for a minor elven Noble family. This is where people began to notice he was not aging. At this time Uri made the decision to attempt to disguise his more than human nature. Fortunately he had made an acquaintance with individuals at the monastery during his time as a poor laborer. He had been called on to do  work at the Monastery during the construction of an addition to their complex and Uri was able to talk with some members of the Monastery. Ultimately he befriended certain members of Tabhor Monastery.

Uri served at the monastery for about 122 years and left the monastery about 280 years ago. He became a member of the Order of Secrets, choosing that order due to their access to ancient, rare, and dangerous lore that may be able to help him address what he had come to think of as his curse. Uri aslo took on a young apprentice, [Andramia Elsinire](people/npcs/andramia-elsinire).

Uri began traveling the world searching for answer: -259 Adeventure Start (AS)
Uri would send letters back to the Andramia every few years concerning my travels. Uri would also send more formal notes back to the Monastery regarding important information that may be useful to the Order of Secrets or Research and Recover, acting as kind of a field agent for the Monastery. Uri would return every half century or so, between the new lives he would set up so as to hide his ageless nature, and stay for a few years.

 Uri spent time as a merchant. It was here he would have traveled to Myrabar and learned dwarven trying to open up trade and get access to Dwarven goods. During the travels Uri made his way to Ket Pirie as it was a trading hub between three major civilizations. In Ket Pirie Uri generally stayed at the Cold Forge Inn. This was an off the main thorough fare Inn, mostly frequented by Dwarves. Uri preferred to allow the other traders and races to frequent the more garish and overpriced Inns in the city center. The Inn was also known for the Dwarven Ale that it brewed. Uri would often try to procure several casks for sale at other locations (usually at a profit given how hard this particular vintage was to come by outside of Ket Pirie). Over the decades Uri became good friends with Baz Fireforge, the owner and brew master, and his family (wife: Frita sons: Baz and Vorn middle daughter: Tali). Uri would try to come around at least once a year as the Cold Forge Ale was one of the few ventures that routinely turned a profit and often offset other losses

Uri was just getting to the end of his "4th life" since leaving Maelhaven for the first time. This life had been spent as a caravan guard, adventurer and a guide to the area around the Sumber Hills. This life had lasted longer than others due to the itinerant nature. Uri would have been setting off to return to the Monastery soon had circumstances not taken him back.
