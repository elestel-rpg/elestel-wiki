## Names

**The GREAT Transmuto!, Fenius Orryn Lythandar Omenwaif Lexipwn Zeddicus Burrowblight Fairbairn Flameheart (GTFOLOLZBFF)**
a.k.a. The GREAT Transmuto! (stage name)
a.k.a. Fen (to his friends)
a.k.a. The Amazing Max (his favorite alternate identity)
a.k.a. Burrowblight (what he calls himself as penance for his "accidents")
a.k.a. "Is Something Burning?"


## Background
Transmuto was raised by a small gnome family until the age of 10, when his power awakened and destroyed his home. From then until the age of 17, he lived in an orphanage, making a bond of brotherhood with a delusional halfling "wizard", who unwittingly helped him in his schemes to work their peers. On their final day at the orphanage a "mysterious" fire burned the building to the ground. A tragic accident, surely; nothing to do with Transmuto's overzealous arcane experimentation in the dusty orphanage basement, or his mild fascination with fire, or his obsession with mystic power. Despite his past leaving him with a slight distrust of his own magic, Transmuto sought even more arcane power, possibly in an attempt to justify his tainted past. So the pair struck out from the smoldering ruins of their former home to fund their "research". This was done mainly through the loose purses of feckless commoners. After all, everyone knows that if you aren't working the marks you _are_ the mark...

## Worldview
* The long-lived races are actually "vitality thieves", siphoning life and vigor from the shorter-lived races. Some do this naturally and are unaware of the effect, and some have attained this power through the practicing of the Dark Arts. Therefore, the secret to their long lives is within the grasp of the canny sage.
* Sometimes the dead *combe back!* -- so you have to give them a good clubbing.
* If you aren't working the marks you *are* the mark.
* Friends and family are sacred. Protect them. The rest can burn. Especially if the flames make pretty colors. And flames *always* make pretty colors.
* All humanoids are equal in the shadow of the Unseen -- except the dirty goblinoids!

## Flaws
* Tends to get lost in contemplation of flickering flames, unless work or an emergency is afoot
* Distrusts his own magic, due to past "accidents", making him prone to "finish the job" in a mundane fashion (for instance, by clubbing the dead bodies left by his magic)
 * Prone to ostentation
* Given to megalomania when faced with enemies

Actions

**Attack Restriction.** A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

**Description.**
The clockwork pseudodragon is a finely-crafted mechanical construct fashioned to mimic a pseudodragon in appearance. If a magic user so chooses, casting Find Familiar within 30 feet of an inanimate clockwork pseudodragon causes it to animate and become the caster's familiar as described in the spell. If the caster chooses a different type of familiar while being the master of an animated clockwork pseudodragon, it once again becomes inanimate, as the magical energy that powered it leaves. Thereafter, the spell functions as normal.
