**(Spoilers from session 3/23/19)**
Casira basically looks like an elf with tiefling coloring and accoutremonts

Casira is a full blooded elf, but because of a pact somewhere in her family background, she is a tiefling (Fey'ri)

At the age of 21, Casira was found by a bypassing Magi and determined to have a magical apptitude. Her family reluctantly let her go with the Magi to the Arcanum, where Elaelan Pexalim volunteered to be her teacher. After what seemed like only a handful of conversations, Elealan seemed to lose interest in being Casira's teacher. And when he did acknowledged her presence, it was as a glorified gopher. After being apprenticed for maybe a month or two, Casira (having taught herself some spells in an effort to prove her ability to her Master) decided to wait for her teacher to come out of a meeting with the other Magi and demand either he begin teaching her or allow her to have another teacher claim her. At that half closed door, Casira witnessed Elaelan's betrayal and slaughter of the other Magi. Being woefully powerless against a powerful Magi and his devil companions, Casira ran. She didn't go home for fear of her family's/villages safetly, but instead lived in the wilds for 10 years. Eventually she began helping those that she came across who were in need of assistance, and that's how Gilli Gan found her.

Fast forward: Having joined the Order of the Guantlet because of Gilli, Casira is a senior member of the Order. Gilli (a high ranking member of the Order) has discovered 2 of the 3 seals the Magi created, and finally has heard mention from a Harper contact of an old friend that she believe's may be in possession of the 3rd seal. Fearing spys and not being able to go herself, Gilli sends Casira to find her friend Rex, and see what happend to him so long ago and if he indeed protects the last seal...
