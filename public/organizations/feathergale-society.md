*The headquarters of the Feathergale Society's dark machinations*
# Description
According to one totally unbiased report, they are a despicable coven of corrupt scions with a lust for murder who feed children to their hippogriff mounts. They have shown a special hatred of halflings, whom they routinely butcher in their tower of evil, which is only to be expected of filthy devil worshipers. They also have bake sales on alternate tendays. *Evil* bake sales.
