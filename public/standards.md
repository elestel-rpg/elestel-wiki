# Wiki Standards

## Naming Conventions
* Link paths with dates should be formated as YYYY-MM-DD so that the files and paths sort correctly.
* Link text should be consistently formatted for human readability. "April 23rd, 2019" is one example.

## Tags
> Put tags in a quote box like this one. All you need to do is add a ">" and a space before any string of tags (or other quoted text).
