# Wiki Standards

## Links
* Link paths with dates should be formated as YYYY-MM-DD so that the files and paths sort correctly.
* Link text should be consistently formatted for human readability. "April 23rd, 2019" is one example.

## Spacing
* Leave an empty line between the end of the content in one topic and the heading for the next topic, as you see between the last bullet point in "Links" and the beginning of "Spacing" above.
