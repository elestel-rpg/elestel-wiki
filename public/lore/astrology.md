# Elestel Astrology
**Astrology and the Elestel Lunar Calendar**

Elestel’s lunar calendar is the chief mechanism behind its astrological system. Elestel has twelve months in its year, each named after a god of Elestel, while the Turn marks the beginning of the year. The Turn is seen as the time of change between the favored moons and the ill moons, and is marked by a festival in honor of the Unnamed.

## Favored Moons
**Spring**

* **Akilos’** Moon Favors the industrious
* **Pixesis’** Moon Favors communion with the dead
* **Vomera’s** Moon Favors battle

**Summer**

* **Phaneos’** Moon Favors resilience
* **Xenne’s** Moon Favors fortune tellers
* **Quzah’s** Moon Favors navigation and leadership

## The Turn

* **Celebration** of the new year, travel, return from journeys, chance, and new beginnings in honor of the Unnamed

## Ill Moons
**Autumn**

* **Feror’s** Moon Portends confusion and loss
* **Siflene’s** Moon Portends tyranny
* **Richimes’** Moon Portends vengeance

**Winter**

* **Marais’** Moon Portends conspiracy
* **Haremes’** Moon Portends chaos and hunger
* **Phesia’s** Moon Portends ruin

There is a five percent chance that creatures will either gain advantage or disadvantage on a roll concerning some action (DM’s choice) in favor or opposition to the nature of the current month on the first day of that month. For instance, a battle executed on the first day of Vomera’s Moon might confer advantage on the planners’ insight rolls concerning the battle to come. For this reason, campaigns of conquest are often launched on the first day of Vomera’s Moon — in secret, to avoid enemies cancelling out one’s luck through planning.

Likewise, almost no one attempts to store food on the first day of Haremes’ Moon, for fear of spoilage — but it’s a good day to invest a town in siege in hopes of starving out one’s enemies.

Legends of divine intervention at these times have grown around these occurrences, and people will often build their lives around such astrological portents. For instance, many people will only marry under the sign of a favored moon, even marrying on the first day of a favored moon who’s nature favors a hope central to the couple, such as marrying on the Unnamed Moon because they will travel a great deal in their new life together. Some rulers marry under the sign of Siflene in hopes of securing absolute power through a political union. Only the rarely will any such attempts to turn fortune in one’s favor matter, but tradition has a strong hold on many.
