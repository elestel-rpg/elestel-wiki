**Day the First,**

Daybreak found us escaped from that accursed dungeon known as Dimrim. Clearly, seeing to the rescue of a poorly-prepared team of scholars was loathsome work indeed. Next time, I shall ask for my fee up front. Who knew acquiring piles of platinum would be so annoying? I mean, liches? Really? I had enough trouble with the demonic in my life without that lot.

Fortunately, the doomsday plague which threatened to escape the dungeon with us was stopped in its tracks via the Captain’s mystic equipage, along with the aide of our priest’s holy artifact, which he’d recovered from the clutches of the Dimrim Lich.

We feared the sickness might spread with the travels of the newly-freed research team, so Friar Leeroy and I flew upon the winds by hippogryph to find them. I took this to mean we should neutralize the threat since we two wielded the cleansing fire which might contain the ancient malady.

After several hours of searching for the rescued researchers, we finally found them on the road headed toward a small settlement. Then were we wracked with indecision; should we set upon them with mystic fire to assure the purging of a great threat to the world, or should we show mercy and restraint, alighting amongst them with tidings of forced confinement and risk of gruesome demise? Finding joy in the notion that mercy now might bring ruin later, I encouraged the priest to land and warn the travelers of their situation and our purpose. I fear they sensed our initial reticence to allow their survival. Still, we had saved them once, so they foolishly acquiesced to our offer of wretched quarantine.

Delg, resourceful Cretan that it is, found a cave for us to shelter in, once we learned that the full complement of quarantined folk could not survive long in the Captains celestial conveyance. In short order, Fubar decided that the company of that ancient crone, Sarya, would be preferred to our august presence. Given the likelihood of eventual slaughter, I wondered why he would leave for such since all he could hope for was a palsied hand and a dusty embrace, cloaked in false youth (most likely fiendish in origin, which would someday require the consumption of souls, mark me), but I digress.

Be as may, I brought Uri scales from my foray about the cave that he declared evidence of basilisk sign! Gentle readers, I have had less reason of late to give in to panic. The Weave has been generous with its power, and so many problems can be solved with fire. However, even I, The Great Transmuto!, gave pause at news that we may share space with the legendary petrifying lizards.

Soon two of the creatures appeared, and the Captain shrouded them in his mystic darkness to prevent our petrification. Immediately, Uri charged into the inky black, and we heard the report of combat. Not to be left out, I used my powers to slow the creatures’ movements, while Leeroy sent a fireball upon them, as we no longer worried for the safety of the old warrior where flames abound. I’ll give the ancient warrior this much: he can take the heat. So I made it even hotter with my own fireball. In short order, the beasts were laid low. As it happened, Uri knew their gullets produced an oil useful for reversing petrification. We had come upon an alchemical bonanza! How often might an adept acquire such materials? It is rare, I say.

Still, despite our success, we feared more enemies might happen upon us, or even innocent travelers we must needs force into quarantine with us, so we prepared the cave to repel any unexpected “guests.” During this time of otherwise convivial toil, Uri made the mistake of attempting a rapprochement with the good Captain, whereupon his peacemaking was rebuffed most emphatically. I believe the quote was, “You fucking tripped me!” And so the eldritch warrior’s efforts were for naught.

**Day the Third,**

Two more days passed, beyond the time of onset noted in the works of the Dimrim Lich, Vaddon Ashworker. None had grown ill, so against my itch to slaughter them all for the good of the world, we decided to release them and return to the monastery.

Uri voiced his displeasure with the insubordination of the Captain’s pet hag, Sarya. Noting with interest a path to wheedling the ancient skull-basher, I argued in her favor, publicly recognizing her usefulness, though the Curator gave more weight to Uri’s arguments. This was no surprise; the aged often hold each others’ counsel in matters of pompous rigidity.

Predictably, Delg and that reprobate, the Captain, wandered into out for a night of debauchery amid pub and pints. I will not regale you with their buffoonery, except to say that their later reports suggest that our exploits have found notoriety among certain of the public, including a shady fellow by the name of Malik claiming an interest in Leeroy’s holy gimcrack, knowledge of which Delg did not divulge.

More useful pursuits were left to the priest and yours truly. Uri sent us to the restricted section of the Library, which I will freely admit made this humble demonologist’s mouth water. Could I find a collection of fiendish true names? Were there records of various immoralities foisted upon the damned of Pandemonium? Can a swallow of any breed truly bear the fabled “co-co-nut” from distant foreign lands upon its migration? The answers to those and other weighty mysteries seemed on the cusp of discovery.

And then we were confronted with that laborious half-wit, Willum the elf, a Library clerk. You’d figure an ancient steeped in the dark arts of demon-powered youthfulness would at least have the dimmest clue about how important my research was, but no! Instead, he whined and moaned about how I’d previously pushed things too far in my attempts to access the area. Even upon the revelation that I bear Uri’s token, he resisted, the impudent fool! It took all my considerable powers of discipline not to incinerate him where he stood.

However, just before my wrath boiled over, Uri showed up to vouch for our admittance. In a shocking display of mental dotage, Willum gave into the old warrior’s commands! I reminded him via obvious gesticulation that I’d been right all along about the power of the token I bore and made sure in no uncertain terms that the wretched elf knew he’d been the fool, for I, The Great Transmuto!, had declared the value of said token. And who was he to gainsay such credit?! Outlandish!

Needless to say, the old fool spent his time bothering us at our research, looking over our shoulders the whole time. One day, the Unnamed will grant me the true power of changeling touch, and Willum may well find that his days as a man-shaped forest frolicker may be adjusted to fit his true inner-self: a toad.
