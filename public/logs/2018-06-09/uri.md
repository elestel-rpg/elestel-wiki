# The Result of a Fool's Decision

**A Month Later – After Securing the Draakhorn**

It has been some time since I have taken time to pen my thoughts and memories. The last month has been eventful. We recovered the Draakhorn. Things could have gone better but they also could have gone much worse. There was only a single casualty, that of Lord Uthadar, who caught us when leaving. Other than him we may have discomforted a number of nobles but otherwise everyone else was unharmed. With luck no one will put together that were involved.

Since then we have been traveling on Stardust’s ship, which is no longer traveling the stars but is traveling the seas. It took us about a month to get to Maelhaven. Along the way I decided that it was a better to sell some of what I collected from the Alchemists Guild in Egley. I am planning on staying with this group for a time and having the coin could be beneficial. Mostly I want to see if I can unravel the mystery of this man who claims to come from the stars and speaks the language of the higher plains. It also will be interesting to see what comes from “The Great Transmuto.” I have seen other arcanists with his abilities in the past but none have achieved the level of mastery that I think I will benefit me. What I am looking for is not a once in a single generation talent but a once in many generations talent, but I have a feeling that Fenius may be one of those. Only time will tell and that is something I have plenty of.

**Returning to Maelhaven**

Andri was right. I am a fool. By all rights I should be dead. Yet, as always seems to happen with me, I live. But this time it is not of my own doing but the actions of allies. The events that unfolded are things I should not forget, lest I repeat my mistakes.

I awoke from a dream of wings and fire and claws only to find myself barely able to move. I was surrounded by what I finally realized were Fenius, Leeroy, Andri, and other members of the monastery and university. The rings were cursed and tried to take me over and away from the Monastery (for what reasons I still do not know), but for the actions of Fenius it would have succeeded. However, removing the rings did not undo the damage, which is why I was so weak. Even the intervention of the gods seemed to not be of much aide. Fortunately, there was someone (Master Tionuu of the University) able to undo what I did to myself in my greed and haste. Unfortunately, he was days away and I was not getting any better, in fact I seemed to be deteriorating. I think Andri avoided saying it but if not for my specific constitution I likely would have died immediately for my reckless actions. We traveled and thanks to assistance from a young hunter were able to track down Master Tionuu for help. I don’t think I was much help at all during the travels as most of it was a blur. I remember plains, and a town but not much else. I meakly leaned on Leeroy and went where we were led. That is until we found signs that Master Tionuu had been attacked and, based on our guide’s assurance, captured and not killed. We were able to follow until we found signs of an encampment. As usual Leeroy and Fenius wanted to just attack. I have already seen too many innocents dead and I was not going to allow any to die for me. I was able tap into a deeper reservoir of strength than I thought I still possessed and end the fight without casualties. Until I knew the nature of the people we dealt with I was not going to allow kids to act rashly on my behalf. Ultimately my caution was unnecessary, these were brigands and specifically the ones that took Master Tionnu. With that knowledge I was more than happy to take a more aggressive posture, especially at this point as I seemed to be getting weaker every time I exerted myself. We found the brigand’s hideout behind an illusion of a massive stone gate. My attempt to knock having resulted in my hand passing through the illusion and nearly into someone’s head. It seemed as if these bandits were easily dispatched by my allies but the fight left me exhausted. I am certain my doublet was soaked with sweat by this point. If I had to fight again I would likely collapse from the exertion. Fortunately, we were able to find Master Tionuu in the cells and he was able to reverse the damage that I foolishly inflicted on myself but it did nothing to reverse my exhaustion, only time could cure that. Thankfully I still had enough of a reserve of strength because we had one last fight. Apparently the leader of these brigands was some kind of necromancer. If he had attacked just a bit sooner, he may have found himself in possession of a rather unique corpse but as fate had it he did not. I had still not recovered but my allies (I should probably say friends at this point considering what they risked on my behalf) had little trouble with him. After that Leeroy took care of the undead army he had raised with the aid of Vomera.

Now it is just a matter of returning to Maelhaven and meeting up with Stardust and Sarya. By then I should be recovered. Regardless of what happens next there is a stop I am going to have to make. I should be dead right now but I live and that requires thanks. I don’t know what her plans are for me (I have not spoken to her since this happened to me) but apparently she is still watching out for me and has put these friends in my path.
