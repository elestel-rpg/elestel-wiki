# Off the Rails!
**A Ball Of Fire, A Mysterious Stranger, A New Beginning**

The investigation into the missing Mirabar delegation in the Sumber Hills was brought to an unexpected end when the party returned defeated to Red Larch only to learn that the surviving members of the Mirabar delegation have been found and the cults of elemental evil responsible for their disappearance had been defeated — by a different group of adventurers!

Upon learning of this turn of events, Mac Fleetwood broke off from the party to seek out the the local representation of the Harpers. There, he was urgently summoned away on unknown Harper business.

While the remaining members of the party braved the celebrating crowds of Red Larch to seek out an evening of rest at the local inn, Uri Thaloma preferred to avoid the crowds and chose to camp alone just outside town. As a result, he was the only member of the party to witness the large fireball that thundered and streaked across the sky well after midnight. A few heartbeats later, an earthquake struck Red Larch, caused presumably by the impact of the mysterious fireball.

The impact site, he surmised, might be rich with materials useful in the arcane arts. Intending to be the first to arrive and collect the spoils, Uri immediately broke camp to seek out fellow party member and arcanist Fenius Flameheart. Together, they gathered the rest of the party (sans Mac) and set out in the direction of the impact.

Near sunset the following day, the party found the crater. As they approached, however, a portal opened in front of them at the lip of the crater and a stranger stepped out. The stranger immediately entered the crater and began to approach the strange looking metalic object at its center, triggering Uri to give chase in hopes of challenging the newcomer for salvage rights. A tense confrontation followed during which the party learned that the newcomer was like nothing the party had ever seen. A foreigner from the stars known as Captain Stardust who used technology so advanced that it appeared to function like an entirely new kind of magic!

After fighting off a surprise attack from local aggressive tribesman and the sudden death of General Raddith from the impact of a fragment of one of the ships , the party and Captain Stardust struck an uneasy alliance and stepped through the the stranger’s portal to an unknown destination…
