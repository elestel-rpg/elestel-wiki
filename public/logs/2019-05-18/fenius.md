**Day the First,**

I awoke to the news that our erstwhile dragon had abandoned his post in the night, probably the captive of his new-found pig-chopper. I resolved to find a solution to the growing problem presented by the ancient scale-monger.  He appeared to be the one sole curmudgeon the world couldn't do without! And he'd disappeared. Well, I had my ways to find him if necessary.

Against that, the lesser infraction of the Arch Bishop tearing his squire from Sarya's decrepit arms to go play in the woods seemed a trifle. Never mind that extremely important wizards might bleed to death alone in their laboratories while attempting to saving the world. No, time to play bugger boys in the woods. I'd call it insufferable, but I know battering rams aren't made less effective by being dull.

Hours later I made for the deck of the *Arcadia* in order to sample the putrid air of the dock, for I very much required a break from my ruminations on the Seal. "Enigma" does not begin to describe the intricate nature of the spell form carved into our taciturn dragon's soul! But I have related that before, and lest you believe that I am already bested by the task, fear not -- for I shall not stoop to hunting you to the end of the world in order to see you rightfully purified of your insolence by the ever-burning fire of my puissance! No, I shall master this pathetic attempt of the ancients to delay annihilation at the hands of the extraplanars foes, and all shall know who saved their worthless skins only to be wasted on such activities as marmalade-making and dirt farming. It will be I, The *GREAT* Transmuto! (Esquire), who has done this thing, and no other!

But I digress.

Upon reaching the deck, I found a clearly insane and incoherent elf (i.e. "life stealer") going on about how he had to see Casira. He claimed his name was Corril, the supposed uncle of Casira's newly-formed essence-purloining niece, Lilly. Quaint how they take the names of the shortest lived creatures, isn't it? All the more reason to distrust the mad being. Even the Captain's talking dog, Jubjub, had attached himself to the madman, clearly suspecting trouble. Why else would he seek to search him and confiscate his belongings? I didn't disagree with the tactic. When the final confrontation came, best to have your foe unwittingly disarmed.

"There is a family emergency!" quoth he, claiming that Lilandra and Casira's niece had gone missing. Well, apart from his other disreputable characteristics, his ability to find our Casira with such apparent ease sparked suspicion in me. And how had he made up so much time getting to us by either cart or skiff? 

His status uncertain, I immediately put him to the Question. Not being a cruel sort and ever the gracious host, I informed him in passing that the ship was a death trap, but he should follow me. I was both curious to see his reaction and to find out if the ship would take my blatant offering of a quick meal and thus ensure our future mystical locomotion. I was disappointed at the lack of wailing and gnashing of teeth. Again, I noted the incredible efficiency of the vessel's soul burning engines. Rarely had I seen finer mystic equipage!

I scanned this so-called Corril in the ship's laboratory. The readings indicated an array of values clearly displaying the man's devious nature, similar to the results of attempting to divide by zero. His confused expression didn't fool me, however. Next, I took him to the lounge and forced into his hands the Xbox wand, lately the downfall of the Arch Bishop. Now, thought I, we'll see how he resists the temptations of our demon ship's machinations! 

Sadly, my tests were interrupted by the crone, Sarya. No sooner had she seen the madman than she started blabbing secrets! Even the one about Casira's whereabouts! Unconscionable. 

Upon meeting the possible imposer, Casira was taken in as surely as Sarya.  She seemed to recognize him and just believe everything. Oh, you just happened to *conveniently* follow your relatives later and just *happened* to find their empty wagon? It smelled like a trap. You never know with life-stealers. For one thing, Casira has fiendish blood. I know how potent such things can be. Never mind that he could truly be anyone, as I knew well from personal experience. We hadn't even compelled a confession yet! Not even one travail of the soul. Where's the use in that, I ask you, my humble readers?

For a moment I thought the Captain would be the voice of reason, forestalling this madness. But I was disappointed when Jubjub's machinations with the man's purse simply provided a pretext to assuage the Captain's mercenary instincts in a bid to *do good* or some such. He had Corril pay him back his own platinum piece placed the man's purse by his familiar and then he agreed to the mission! I was aghast, but I  held my reaction in check. 

Seeing Casira's willingness to follow this stranger's lead, I practiced my own due diligence by going along to watch him. You can never be too careful. A fiend-begotten woman's blood might be quite tempting to certain folk.

In preparation for the trip, I contacted the Arch Bishop, informing him of our plans to rescue Casira's "relatives." I was shocked to find out he wanted to meet us there, dragging his squire headlong into pointless danger, which is to say I was in no way surprised.

After a days travel upriver, we disembarked and followed the road North. We noticed that not far beyond the port town the trees alongside the road began to look sickly.  Not long into the day, we came upon the smoking ruins of the sought-after wagon. The entire area stank of demon sign, being the aftermath of a battle the fiends had clearly lost. A full dozen extra-planar corpses of the fiendish kind littered the area along with many beasts. I saw at least four unique kinds of netherbeing present among the dead. Mindful of my purpose, I set about collecting samples. You never know when the horn of a horned devil might come in handy.

Casira soon found the tracks of a survivor, and we followed her into the woods. Normally, this would be the sign of an utter fool. Why would you follow creatures that had clearly destroyed a pack of fiends?  And this would be a good thought for average folk. They should stay locked in their shabby hovels, afraid of the world, quaking in the dark at every passing sound. It is left to ones such as I to vanquish those threats and be lauded by the unwashed masses, as they grovel before me!

But I digress.

Casira revealed that the humanoid tracks belonged to a dryad, a life-stealer of the forest. No doubt the horrid creature did battle with the fiends as recompense for polluting its food source, sacrificing its hapless woodland minions in the process. It probably thought it was "protecting" the very trees it enslaved within its vampiric union. One wonders, could they but speak, what the trees would say about that!

Aware of the despoiled vegetation around us, I was nowise surprised when a horde of eight fiends assailed us. Most think the sensible course of action would be to shrink away in terror at the sight of extra-planar horrors. Most are wrong! One must never show fear in the face of the Abyss. Therefore did I judiciously position myself behind our new-found Tabaxi ally, Trixie, allowing her to rend and tear at the foul creatures to her heart's delight. As she whirled about, I slowed time for our enemies. This allowed each to feel their downfall in exquisite detail. I know; it was too good for them. But we must keep up our standards.

For but a moment did I see a most vicious horned devil leading them. Then the Captain raised his hands, calling upon a force I have yet to understand. Still, I knew the spell form well enough. In the next moment the creature vanished -- or rather was *banished* from our plane. As Trixie's fists and claws created mists of blood before me, I had a short time to take stalk of our situation. More than half our foes were already down or moving as through a pool of treacle. One fiend had slipped beyond the grasp of my mystic weaving, coming for us with intent to kill. I could see the malevolence in its wretched simian countenance. I sneered and called forth black tentacles from the Stygian realms to ensnare him and his allies.

It seemed like such a long interlude, but as the whipping mass of death squeezed our foes from their mortal coil, I came to see how adroitly we had bested them. There were few enough screams of pain or terror. A clinched fist, a crushing tentacle, a few whizzing bolts. Then silence.  I smiled in satisfaction and began collecting my precious samples from the bloody remains, clubbing the dead for good measure. Many say this is madness, but many haven't seen the dead walk again among the living!

The cleanup done, we continued on our way. The dusk had turned to night not long after that. Then in the darkness I found the vegetation at my boots an increasing impediment until I realized the grass itself sought to snare me. Outraged, I conjured myself to our flying carpet, whereupon stood our suspicious "guide," Corril.  I gave him my best, "herumpn!" and then turned back to the forest ready to lay waste to the source of the present insolence.  Then did I spy the dryad, propped up against a tree in obvious distress. The wretched sap-sucker dared to try her witchery upon my personage!  I nearly unleashed the fury of my great staff upon her, but in that moment Casira interposed herself betwixt my target and I.  

I confess that, for the most fleeting moment, I considered their combined immolation. After all, things *happen* in war. I believe they call it "fratricide." The itch to burn all before me seemed to light the world for an instant. Could I be blamed? I could free the tree from its servitude to the root witch, indeed the whole forest from its mystic shackles, all in one cleansing conflagration! Yet I staid my hand. 

In this world even one such as I does better with allies. And I had to confess that Casira had proven useful in curbing some of the excesses of our Doomsday dragon. The more I considered the idea, the less palatable her destruction seemed, even if it meant allowing the perpetual enslavement of the surrounding forest. It was a minor sacrifice in truth; had I not just that morning offered up her own "relative" (likely story!) to the *Arcadia* in hopes of a minor increase in convenience? Against that, what mattered a forest of trees?

With all prudence I withdrew my staff and lied, "We are your allies! We have vanquished those who would harm your forest."

The haughty twig muncher didn't so much as respond to my parlay! No, instead she listened to Casira's Elvish gibbering. An obvious mistake, considering how easily the woman was swayed by strange men calling at her doorstep. I resolved to keep my wizard's fire warm.

The captain floated forward on his boots and gave succor to the ailing tree trollop. This seemed to brighten her mood, and soon she was leading us through the forest rather than running away. Casira related that the creature knew where her family had hid themselves and would lead us unto them. I twitched with suspicion, but I kept my peace, sure that any convenient ambushers would simply provide me with more samples.

In little time we came upon a glade dominated by an ancient tree spreading its canopy of leaves and branches above us. It's trunk widened in an unnatural way, forming into the obvious abode of a powerful tree hugger witch. My nose wrinkled with the obvious odor of druid before I even laid eyes on the woman before the great tree.

In short order we learned her name was "The Mother."  Yes, a name even more pretentious than the standard of her kind, which unsurprisingly was elf. I considered her advanced age and wondered how many innocents had been sacrificed to her centuries. One day I would crack that mystery.

She welcomed us into her tree house. Within we found Casira's family awaited, and there was much rejoicing among them. I would have joined in under the hope of eventual inebriation, but something I saw gave me a bit more than pause. The place was overrun with a swarm of unnaturally tame tree rats, so-called "squirrels." And they were *playing* with Casira's niece! Dear reader, you know I am a master of the ways of the fiend. However, I tell you this: little is as disturbing as seeing a lower creature whose natural inclination should be to run in fear from a superior being so warped that instead of fleeing it enjoys playtime.  Appalling doesn't cover it. And then, to my distress, Jubjub  *joined in!* 

My skin crawled. The desire to burn the entire tree down roiled up in me, but there is a difference between power and madness, and I dared not invoke the ire of an arch druid.

Casira related our story and present struggles to The Mother, and she seemed moved. She said she could offer little in the way of aide, but she conferred upon Trixie her late sister's monk wraps, the surface of the white cloth splotched with ancient blood stains. 

The Mother even saved Casira the trouble of looking after her own family, as she offered to train Lilandra and protect her niece.

In an admittedly unnatural moment I spoke up, "Yes, this is all *very* nice. But we really must be going. Dragons to find, peasant-riddled world to save, yes?"  I eyed a tree rat trying to cozy up to my feet, and I nearly kicked it before remembering how vicious its mother might become should I mist one of her furry slaves.

Finally, we managed to flee, and in short order we made it beyond the borders of The Mother's more obvious power. I was finally able to sleep, safe in the knowledge that I wouldn't be forced to share my bedroll with a mesmerized rodent or two.
