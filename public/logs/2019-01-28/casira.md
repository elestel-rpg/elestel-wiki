# A letter "home"
Dearest Vulas and Lilandra,

I hope everyone is well. I miss you all dearly. I hope to be able to see you all again soon, but my plans don’t always align with what my heart wants. I fear for the days ahead and what they may bring. Lilly, don’t let my brother bury himself so far into his work that he forgets to look around now and then. Be vigilant. And give that sprite of yours a bear hug for me (though not literally!). Jesting aside, I’m sending dad’s dagger to you. I’d like for it to remain with the family should something happen to me. It’s still a very good dagger, maybe one of you will start to teach Amara how to use it. Or you’ll put it on the mantle in remembrance and keepsake. Either way, I want you to have it. And before you complain that I’m just being morbid, remember what I do and what I am. There are no certainties in my life.

Even now, things are tense and uncertain where I am. Though, I do have to say I feel the most comfortable with this band of misfits as I have in a long time. I don’t know what to make of that yet. They tend to get into trouble wherever they go. Sometimes they are the cause, but usually it finds them. And the one I told you about, that I was sent to find? I get more pleasure than I should in his cat and mouse games that he tries to play with me. He fails to realize he merely needs to ask a question to get most answers. Though I get irrationally vexed when he treats everyone around him like a lower being. I thought I was old enough to have my temper more under control.

There’s a young cleric in our group that sometimes makes me think of you, Vulas, when you were much younger and prone to getting into trouble. Maybe that’s why I’m feeling a bit homesick right now. He worships Vomera like daddy did… There’s also the Captain of the vessel we travel in. He’s almost as reserved as the “cranky old man”. From what I’ve gleaned he comes from far off lands, I would be reserved around such strangeness too. Then there’s the young wizard in our group. He alternately feels harmless, albeit crazy, and also seems the most likely to try and kill me in my sleep once he knows more about me. Time will tell.

There’s a young elf maiden onboard, she’s like the second in command, a mechanic/engineer, and a historian all rolled into one. I haven’t talked with her much, but I do know that she’s out in the world on her own at a much younger age than is usual. We have that in common if nothing else. She seems far more put together than I did at that age. I feel a need to keep her safe from the horrors I fear are coming and also don’t want to smother her. She gets enough mentoring from the old man, and it seems the Captain to a degree. She doesn’t need a strange old tiefling barging into her life and trying to help her. No matter my weird desire to create a bond with her over similar beginnings.

For now, that’s where my life stands. I cannot repeat again how urgent my feeling is that you all keep vigilant. Inform the town elders if you think they will listen. I wish I could tell you more, but letters are easily intercepted and the less you know the better. I sincerely hope this package makes it to you, with it carrying father’s dagger and all. Stay safe. I love you.
