**Day the Fourth,**
The dock at Egley smelled of rotting fish and other unsavory fumes, as is common. It was, too me, a kind of fresh air. Despite a curious lack of true demon sign, I grew tired of my vigilance upon the Captain’s vessel. Where were the howling and gnashing of teeth that must needs regale any abyssal craft? Where were the piteous cries of lost souls, born to bondage through the brutal sloughing of their mortal coil at the hand of evil? I’d come to realize that the Captain had hit upon a device of true efficiency. Could it be that a mere twenty¬ souls could power such an immense craft for so long? Uncanny! And yet, before I could discover more, the Captain had pulled the ship from the harbor, as docking costs 15 gold a day. Robbery, indeed, in more ways than one. Still, we had come to see a evil subdued by way of this Draakhorn’s retrieval — for the proffered weight of gold, mind you, and I am little if not mercenary in my predilections.

The priest, Uri, and I rendezvoused with Delg at the appointed residence in the merchant district, after much knocking at the door. The creature wouldn’t allow that its shoddy disguise proposed little else except its true identity, such as it is. It doesn’t seem to realize that a true elf is never that tall – nor so misshapen. The ruse foiled, Delg let us in and related the fruits of its clandestine engagements since our separation. It learned, after making contacts, and reconoitering the Builder’s Hall, that the Draakhorn was likely stored in a vault within the estate of Lord Uthadar. Luckily, a party was to be held at the fell lord’s estate, to which we meant to be … party.

Thus we set out to plan our caper. Delg had managed to turn a certain lord’s mistress to ill humor in preparation for causing a scene – and convenient distraction — the night of the party, while Uri, the priest, and I intended to act as guards for the soiree. Delg would accompany Stardust as guests, insane as that sounded to my ears. The odds of success seemed ludicrous to the point of infinitesimal, however the opportunity for mayhem seemed extreme.

Of course, for such a gem of a plan to function, we needed to get ourselves hired. I haven’t been forced to exert myself alongside the common vermin in years, ever since my ascension to my current title of Great, but I remember the labor pits well, as they huddled amid their stench just outside the orphanage, which also burned to cinders through no fault of my own. Many was the time when Lua Maan (R.I.P.) and I would go down to the pits with buckets of rotten provender and cast morsels upon the wretches from a great height, as they labored in the heat of day. It was a kindness, I know. Especially as they couldn’t hear our gleeful chortling. So you see, well did I know the travails of the common man, for I, The Great Transmuto!, have been among them.

Braced with good cheer, secure in my ability to impersonate one among the squalid masses via a judicious use of the Weave, Uri, Leerpy, and I took ourselves to the guardsmen’s training yard, where the good Sergeant Baz presided over the hiring of men-at-arms for the lord’s party. Unfortunately, there were only two position available. Of course, our elderly swordsman, likely invigorated by unholy magicks, flourished his weapon and attacked the evil wooden targets with abandon! This impressed the Sergeant, and so Uri found employment for a night. Next, Father Leeroy, more accustomed to bringing down the light of Vomera upon a shattered world, did little shattering of his own, as his war hammer missed its target.

You should know, fair reader, that one such as I eschews the use of such crude implements. What use has a Great One of the Weave for such glorified toothpicks? None, says I! Therefore, did I cast a glamour such that all would know that other men are beneath me in skill, or so I made it seem. With the mere wiggle of a finger, the Weave did my bidding, and Sergeant Baz could see only how deftly I handled his pig stickers. And so I was hired along with Uri to “guard” the lord’s party. Unfortunately, our priest was left to find other employment with the servants of the lord’s estate.

Later that day, while wearing yet another face to fool the wrong eyes, I trailed Uri to see what may be seen of the Builder’s Hall security. I could sense no magic within. Soon I caught up with the old warrior, who had found the Alchemists’ Guild, but we were too late to bargain with our special basilisk oil. Upon returning to the safehouse, we discussed the unreliable nature of the Delg creature. Uri seemed not to trust the being, a stance from which I would never attempt to dissuade him. I have seen dog and demon and all manor of creatures between, but not yet have I seen another Delg, sole representative of its enigmatic kind. Who could trust in such? The conversation reminded me that I bivouacked among youth-stealers and those who would treat with fell spirits, the elderly warrior not least among them! But I agreed with his sense of caution. We would proceed carefully.

**Day the Fifth,**

The next morning, Uri and I left to visit the commercial district again, hoping for better luck than the previous outing. We came upon a shop of “magical” curiosities. I was nowise impressed by the mystic trinkets, their quality of a lesser species than even my own novice attempts in the basement of the orphanage. One could barely claim for them the possession of magic.
While perusing said wears, the rest of our fellows did find us. Unfortunately, it turns out that our good priest, though given to the light of heaven, was too high amongst all that glory to realize when he’d been marked by an unscrupulous merchant. The proprietor, even attempted, with little success, to showcase her mystic equipage by compelling him to smile. I could do naught but dissolve in fits of laughter at the sad event, yet the priest could not manage to leave the store without parting with a bit of his gold! How, by the mysteries of the Unnamed, can a man find a cloak that needs no wind to billow a worthy item of apparel? It’s fascinating, really.
Not long after leaving the gimcrack shop, we made our way back to the Alchemists’ Guild. Strangely, the only occupants in evidence were a pair of guards. Uri sought to sell our basilisk oil, but was rebuffed by the senior, a woman named Kewliza. She made claim that we’d have to come back later to do business, but something seemed strange. Both the guards gave off a feeling of unease.

As is typical, Uri decided it was his business, so he began to gently pry away at the poor skull bashers. It took time, and even an appeal to authority through his association with the Monastery, but eventually Kewliza confided in us that trouble of a nebulous kind had befallen the guild. Eager to see what items might be liberated from the clutches of this backwater, I readily strode into the teeth of the unknown. For what, said I, could befall such a place that we could not handle? We had the aid of a god, the power of the Weave, a demon-tainted immortal, and a Delg. Clearly, we would have the upper hand come what may.

We found the hall deserted, until we came into an anteroom soaked in water. Uri and I moved to a side door, which opened into a kitchen. Uri opened the pantry door and was immediately assailed by a squeal and a cloud of white powder. Little did the attacker know that such minor inconveniences like blindness had little effect on the man. The attacker turned out to be a frightened gnome woman babbling about trolls. In short order, we escorted her to safety before returning to our mission.

When we opened the door to the ballroom, we saw a man sitting at a table gazing into a flask of red liquid, transfixed. He kept asking us to leave, madness clear in his voice. However, we could gain no information from him and turned out attention elsewhere. Delg went off to another side room, and was soon attacked by a guild member! The man was obviously effected by some kind of enchantment, but survival always wins out against the salvaging of mental abuse victims, so we set to slaying the man where he stood. Down the hall from that struggle, I could make out another man mumbling some kind of incantation! So I mumbled back, hoping to disrupt his concentration, but counter mumbled my mumble, the upstart! In seconds the room was engulfed in a fireball, leaving us singed and quite put out. Of course, this did little to aid the enemy, as we dispatched him and his in the next few seconds. You see, occasionally traveling among the demon-tainted has its perks.
