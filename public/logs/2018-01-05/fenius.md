**Day the First,**

I woke at the noise of rustling bed sheets. As is typical for their sordid ilk, I found Delg cozying up to the Captain in a most immodest fashion, whereupon the Captain rose to slink away, belike to a new conquest of ill repute. At least he has taken his celestial crotchworms with him!

My superior intuition tells me that nothing welcome would beget following the Captain at the early hour, but upon rising, I do find the party whole and mostly washed. Delg and Stardust tell of their suspicious meeting with one Master Malick in a bar. This Malick was of a mind to ply them for knowledge of our recent exploits at the accursed Demrim. He even seemed interested in our priest’s new amulet! I’d say word had flown with suspicious alacrity, if I didn’t already grasp the nature of our resident skulker. No doubt Delg had made himself the center of all manner of daring do – the securing of the amulet among them.

It turns out that this Mallick was associated with great wealth, as Stardust followed his carriage by mystic flight all the way to Kompton, one of the wealthiest districts in Maelhaven. Immediately, my mind turned to the possibility of liberating the man’s patrons of their burdensome wealth in exchange for exclusive access to my many potent tinctures and elixirs. Had I only the time, my preparations would have actually worked, but such a minor detail shouldn’t stand between my purse and its rightful share of gold, should it?

In time, we decided against the ruse of employing a fake amulet to impress Mallick, as such a counterfeit could not be acquired in time for our meeting. To my surprise, there was little enough discussion about whether to even take the man seriously! However, the confirmation of his connection to wealth settled the matter for me, and it seemed likewise with my fellows. Surely, he was of little note, but his patrons might be persuaded to our liking.

That settled, we sought aid from the Monastery’s Gatekeeper, Master Imrac. I’ve had scant interaction with the black Dragonborn, all to the good. But despite his fearsome aspect, he was known to be a good man, if short on the sufferance of foolishness. As some of lesser intellect have styled interactions with me “foolish,” I’ve sought to steer clear of Master Imrac’s attention, but I cannot deny that we had good cause now.

Yet, apparently, Master Imrac disagreed with my assessment. I stood well behind the others, placing them betwixt me and any bilious acid spewed forth by the stoic Dragonborn, as he rejected our quite reasonable request for a squad of his finest soldiers to support our efforts. He did, however, release a scout to warn the Monastery if any ill should befall our excursion – and to warn us with a flare if he should see signs of ambush. With that, we accepted his gruff dismissal. All the better to be away from his presence, I say!

The Company met with Andramia next, who shared a suspiciously conspiratorial wink with the good Captain before bestowing upon him a rapier of indeterminate quality. Uri, keen to test the abilities of our celestial interloper, challenged him to a friendly duel. Stardust managed to hold his own, to my surprise. I wasn’t expecting a practitioner of the dark arts to show such familiarity with the blade. After all, everyone knows that bludgeons are best for signing your work, not producing it.

Anywise, we arrived at the meeting place early, a warehouse nestled in the heart of the industrial district. Delg, showing his clearly non-elf nature, had so much trouble climbing to the roof that it required Stardust’s help! I’d call it shocking, but I’m onto the ruse, if not the underlying nature of it. But in otherwise good order, the being places itself outside the warehouse overlooking the meeting. To “cover” us, apparently. I can’t say I’m comforted at the thought.

Within the warehouse, Malik approaches us with two guards at his side. This doesn’t worry me, for I, The Great Transmuto!, am more than a match for such a paltry display of “muscle.” What is muscle against the infernal wrath of the Weave unleashed? I shouldst immolate their pathetic man-bodies to dust and scatter their remains to the four winds as offering to the unending hunger of the Unseen, before they so much as threaten my person!

But I digress.

After all, burning their servants is no way to win free the gold of moneyed interests. But Malik refuses to inform us further concerning his true identity, or that of his patrons, a group he claims is in opposition to dark forces. But aren’t they always? Who sells their cause by admitting to the service of evil? Only the Kardashians, and we all know what happened to that fabled clan. I say “no thanks” to endless wailing and gnashing of teeth! Not that anyone could miss the yearly display of their ghosts’ tortured state. It makes me wonder why any would worship the Evil Ones. Even I, The Great Transmuto!, demonologist extraordinaire, would only seek to bend their servants to my purpose – or defend others against their own dark aims.

But I digress.

It turned out that Malik sought our help in acquiring an artifact of power, the Draakhorn, said to be capable of both warning and calling chromatic dragons from around the world. Then did our ancient warrior, Uri, begin to shake with ill-concealed rage. I edged a bit further back, not wanting to be subject to the arc of his blade. After all, one needs arms to cast spells in most cases, and I knew the time was soon approaching when violence would be the order of the day! Ever is such the course with this Company. So be it; not one among us lacks a wrong in need of accounting in blood.

Unexpectedly, negotiations broke out instead of bloodshed. Even Delg exposed its position, shouting out inanities in order to take part in the dealing. But before anything was settled for true, Malik took a bolt to the chest!

Then did chaos prevail, as figures appeared both above us along the rafters and beside us outside the windows. The warehouse doors creaked open, and we were rushed by brigands en masse. Before I could give them over to their doom, our priest enveloped them in his god’s burning wrath, ending the ones at the door. It always warms my heart when witnessing those who deserve it burn.

Still, some survived this divine display, and so I glued them in time until they seemed to move through treacle. Once they surrounded me and the Captain, he signaled me, and I stepped close to him. A thunderous report shook the warehouse, and I found myself transported to the rafters to contend with an assassin, leaving the broken remains of our previous foes behind. I attempted to restrain her with the sure grip of Maximillian’s hoary hand, but as it sprang forth, the little minx sidestep it. Outrageous! And before I could counter, she set off a foggy cloud from a bolt, blinding me. The Captain, eager to make her acquaintance, refused to allow such an inconvenience stymy him, and so he shot through the cloud onto the roof, risking great injury. I, good reader, practiced good sense and bravely stood my ground against any new threat, protecting all and sundry, as the drama below played itself out.

Uri, not forgetting his previous rage, struck Malik and evoked from the man great fear. I float down to assist in the festivities, only to find Uri in enough control that he is questioning the man rather than tearing him to ribbons, as I’d expected. After all, Malik may have been party to the ambush, his wound only a seeming and naught else.

Soon, the Captain stepped in to save Malik’s guards from sacrificing themselves needlessly for the man. We learned that Malik was one Malik Torgar, a minor noble. He claims allegiance to a group he calls the “Shadow Resistance” sworn to counter the “Shadow Council,” who are presumably the ones who sent the assassins. This Shadow Council, he said, is given over to darkness and imperils the world. Well, of course! What else? There’s always some simpleton power monger or another seeking their fortune by casting the rest of the world into chaos. The mistake this group made is in attacking the one Company who might end them forthwith: The Celestial Salvage Company! Primarily due to the fact that they had the temerity to assault yours truly, of course. There is no better way to mark one’s self for death!

Malik notes that the assassin who fled behind the sudden fog cloud was most likely Alilynn Darkeyes. One wonders how successful an assassin could be when her name is so well known, but why quibble when she’s clearly marked for death either way?

After all, my club may well break before I’m done with all my new enemies. No one tries for my life without cost, and the cost will be heavy indeed!
