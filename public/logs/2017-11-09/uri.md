# The Descent into Demrim
***Excerpts from the Journal of Uri Tahlomah***

**Resting in the Lab**
Well we’ve found most of the research team. There are only two still missing and it appears as if they have been dragged deeper into the city by some intelligence. With this many undead it is likely a Lich. This could be a problem, especially as there is little discipline amongst this group and they appear to be expending themselves at a rapid pace. At this rate they are going to be exhausted which will leave me Delg and maybe Fubar to pull everyone out alive. Worse yet none of them seem to have any particular strength against the undead, so we just keep hacking them to peices. Thankfully Delg seems to know how to track as well so hopefully we can find the last two members of the research team fast and get out before people wear out.

On that note about Delg, I must say that despite his off putting nature, and whatever secrets he’s hiding behind the masks and disguises, he is a very skilled professional. It is a bit of a relief to have another one of those around. Stardust is out of his element and has no clue what we’re going to be diving into. At best I hope he doesn’t get us injured or worse. Leeroy is still reckless (as if being hit by his fireball did not prove that) but he’s better and he may be crucial here, most clerics have some way to at least turn away the undead if not outright kill them. And Fenius is well Fenius. I knew what I was getting into with him at least but I did not think that meant undead. I really hope I can keep him alive long enough that he might be able to help me.

**After Searching the Lab**
Talk about old, this journal was written in a dialect of dwarven that predates anything I have encountered, fortunately (as annoying as it is to admit) Stardust’s magic was able to translate it. It confirms that this in fact Demrim. That is good news for Andri as it means her team was sent to the right place and that this place could be a store house of untold knowledge of that era, preserved in its isolation. Unfortunately it also explains why the place was sealed and lost. This plague needs to be taken seriously. Hopefully it has not already claimed the research team, which we need to make sure are quarantined on Stardust’s ship, and our merry band of children. I should be fine, diseases generally don’t impact me but the others are not that hearty, with the possible exception of Fubar.

**A few paragraphs later**
This amulet is something else. It bears a symbol of Vomera and it seems drawn to Leeroy, even reacting to him. Even if the previous bearer of it could not use it to cleanse the plague maybe this reaction is a sign that another may be able to cleanse it.

**A few more paragraphs later**
Well forget what I said about Delg. That abominable fog cloud nearly ended me and seemed to have no impact on the undead monstrosity we fought. Based on his reaction and what he said before Stardust took out his jaw, that was Vaddon Ashworker or at least what was left of him. He seemed obsessed with the disease and was going to use the members of the research team that he captured of test subjects. We need to be careful because they may already be infected and we cannot let the plague get out. Now that we’ve found these last few we need to catch up and make sure the rest of the team is isolated until we know what’s going on.

Overall I have to say this group of individuals did better than I gave them credit. Many others’s I’ve traveled with would have gotten themselves killed and likely doomed the researchers. They may be children but they are figuring out how to handle themselves. A few more decades and they may be a force to reckon with. I hope I’ll get the chance to see it. Leeroy came up with a way for Fenius and I to see (I hate being blind) and they held themselves back enough during the journey to deal with Vaddon’s little helpers. And as annoying as I find Stardust, seeing him take a shot right at Vaddon’s face was funny. If the ascent is like the descent Fubar and I should be able to shelter the rest of the group with basic weapons until we reach the surface. Once there I am going to have to take a look at that amulet and more time with Vaddon’s journal. Thanks to Stardust’s deciphering I think I’ve figured out the changes in the language over the years and can read it. . These are truly great finds. These artifacts should also help Andri cement her position.
