**Day the First,**

As it happened, we were able to extract a greater portion of our fee from Malick than I would have thought possible. That greatly improved my view of his commitment – and the seriousness of our new quest. But really, it doesn’t get any more serious than hunting down those who would destroy you. And now I even get paid to do it. In the end, the Company managed to acquire 500 gold from the man, with another 250 promised even before completion of our task, and yet another 250 gold upon recovery of the Draakhorn. Honestly, I think the task is worth more than that, given that we are to contend with great and powerful interests. But all men die. Especially those who would use my head for proof!

Upon returning to the Monastery, I immediately sought to inform Mistress Andramia of our situation. It was the prudent option, considering Uri had gruffly sped off in the direction of the Library. You see, he’s a taciturn fellow at times. It must come with the withering onset of decrepitude. I mean, how would I feel if I should need to clear the air of dust from my bones with every motion? I suspect it’s the magic that props the fellow up, possibly mediated by the blood of virgins. My father noted such rituals were sometimes performed among the fell. Long have I suspected the elves to number among such practitioners, for who knows what the Treefolk conspire to amid dell and wood? And spare of such environs though it may be, within the Monastery elves yet abound! Indeed, so mysterious is the connection betwixt Uri and Andramia that one could be forgiven for suspecting such a fell pact of blood obtains betwixt them.

But I digress.

After reporting to Andramia, and acquiring new magicks for the ordeal ahead, I joined the Captain and our priest, as all of us seemed interested in what new insights might be gleaned from the restricted portion of the Library.

Upon our arrival, I saw that the pustulent bookwart, Willum, still infested the desk. I schooled my face and, with forthright charm and confidence, announced thusly: “Willum, you repugnant sheepskin monger! Allow me to introduce you to your doom forthwith if you do not allow us immediate entrance as Master Uri has requested. At once, you dusty taint, before I dispel that foul demon pact you call your ‘youth!’”

With shocked obeisance, Willum ushered us into the restricted section’s first floor, along with a clutch of his fellow minders. You see? Even with the hovering ninnies, I was able to confer with our secretive warrior. Uri related that the Draakhorn did indeed call upon dragons, specifically dragons of the chromatic variety. I shuddered; much would I prefer to contend with a denizen of Pandemonium than risk the ire of an ancient chromatic wyrm. Still, I listened, for ever have I faced the darkest corners of my own doom in hopes of averting its dawn.

Unfortunately, we were hounded by the Library’s minders every second. The fools seemed to keep a particularly close eye on me, for some reason. Me, the very model of probity. I was shocked and offended by such indirect libel. They even had the audacity to claim that I, The Great Transmuto!, would stoop so low as to remove several important volumes from the restricted section, as if by theft, whereas I was just collecting them for a good long and peerlessly legitimate read on retainer. Foolish reprobates!

Afterward, Uri requested volumes on various cultures for the Captain’s benefit. Even the Captain asked after simple children’s books, as no one could expect an alien to not someday seek the blood of the innocent at table for an unintended slight, as customs must differ among the star-scattered realms. For himself, Uri chose a primer on Celestial, the tongue of the Captain’s people.

**Day the Second,**

The next morning, the Captain prevailed upon me to aid him in the requisitioning of provender from the quartermaster, for our journey would require many supplies. Knowing the man’s corrupt proclivities, I fully expected an attempt to clean out the Monastery’s supplies. Mine own itch for the simpler days of the street show called to me when considering his request, and I agreed, hoping to revel in the minor distraction.

In truth, I impressed even myself, for rarely had I fashioned such an immaculate chit. The difficulty and strain of the effort nearly broke my composure, to be sure, but once I neared the end of my labors, the pace quickened, leaving me in relief. Then did we regale the quartermaster with our tale legitimate service to the Monastery, not without some mystic aid from the Captain’s own store of alien powers.

“Good sir!” quothe I to the quartermaster. “See you here this chit?”

“Yes,” said he, his eyes wide. “That’s some chit you’ve got there.”

“Why, of course! We of Celestial Salvage only offer the finest, most reputable chit.”

“I mean,” said the Captain, “have you ever seen chit like this?”

“No chit,” said the quartermaster, glancing back at a pile of chits on his desk, “like your chit, sir.”

“No chit?” said I.

“No chit,” replied the quartermaster. Then most assuredly did I feel a glow of accomplishment.

“Indeed!” interjected the Captain, cutting us off. He knew full well that I was on the cusp of indulging in chitchat. “Now, I shall need a full month’s provisions for six by morning, good man.”

I schooled my face and managed to suppress a guffaw. Small wonder that the quartermaster, beset as he was, managed to talk the Captain down to a mere week’s supplies. Nothing showed the man’s alien nature more than the expectation that such a task could be done.

**Day the Third,**

The Company met in the courtyard the next morning. Even Sarya, that aged elf adolescent, came prepared to journey with us, much to my relief, for she had proved herself invaluable during our ordeal in Demrim.

But then I was forced to school my face once again, as a Druid made an appearance among us. Who knew what such beings get up to in their trees? I often wonder if the forests of the world would do better without their molestations. Still, I knew from the beginning that our task would require working with treemongers; Carric, as he called himself, looked weak, though I knew he must be a most puissant soilbagger, or he’d never have been chosen for the task.

To the druid’s amazement, we teleport to the Captain’s celestial conveyance. In short order, Sarya found an eligible crate – surrounded by “life signs,” as she put it.

We teleported down to the edge of the crater which surrounded our goal. A band of orcs had happened upon it, and were busy banging away at the invisible storage device. Truly, it amused me to see even their wise one poking at the “invisible hill.” But we had a job to do. When we started discussing violence and mayhem as possible solutions, Carric spoke up, saying he refused to be a part of any bloodshed.

Of course, this just confirmed my growing suspicions of his cowardice, which poured off of him in waves. In the end, we settled on a plan.

I raised my hands, and a rumbling seemed to imenate from the ground beneath us. On the other side of the crate, the ground appeared to split asunder in gouts of lava. Eight eyestalks, crowned by wicked globes larger than a man’s head, rose from the fissure, followed by the floating body of a beholder. The iris of its great central eye seemed made of undulating talons, and the maw that gaped beneath it, ringed with forearm-sized fangs, let loose a roar. As it began to float toward us, the orc band saw what came for them and ran in terror – right into our midst.

Instead of running past us, they chose to fight, which meant they also chose to die, happily enough. To the shock of none, our priest chose that moment to enlighten them with Vomera’s holy fire, removing a portion of their number from contention. The Company scythed through them then in short order, even as I cancelled their wise one’s pathetic attempt at conjuration. For some reason, our warrior had trouble with the last tuskdragger, and I was forced to dispatch it with wizard fire.

Not wanting to reveal my gambit, I stepped over to the illusory beholder I’d summoned and pet the creature, as if on good terms with it. “Good boy, Eyesoar!" said I. "Next time I think you can follow them all the way to their wretched hovels and have your fill, but you should go now.” And then did I send my “pet” back to the Nethers so that all who might spy upon the event should know I, The Great Transmuto!, did rule over such a fiend.

That done, the druid set to righting the crate in preparation for its retrieval. Though it took hours, no one disturbed us. As it turns out, beholders make even the curious shy. A few hours after the midday meal, the crate was righted, lifted up to the Captain’s vessel, and Carric was on his way, flying off into the distance as a bird. I could feel the Weave moving around me at the sight; soon enough I too would be able to do much the same and more. Willum had better watch his words on that day, mark me!

Upon the Captain’s order, Sarya “deorbited” the ship, and she became a sea-faring vessel! Marvelous! I admit a sudden itch to tinker with her instruments, but I know a fell temptation when I see one. I fear our priest does not, seeing as he immediately immersed himself in one of the Captain’s game machines — again. I retired to the lounge, hoping to study a bit more in preparation for our coming hunt, however Uri passed by looking ill to my eye. He refused to answer my inquiry about his health, but I know a sour stomach when I see one, just as I know demon taint itself! And so I infused my stone with the power of internal fortitude. Nowise did I feel need to share my lunch with the denizens of the sea.
