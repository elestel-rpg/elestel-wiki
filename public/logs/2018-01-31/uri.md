# Return to Maelhaven

Upon Returning to Maelhaven after Researching in the Restricted Sections
Well it seems that the Library had more than they realized on Demrim, we were just missing a number of pieces to put it all together, like the Amulet. What Fenius, Leeroy and I found should keep the Archivists busy for some time trying to piece together the larger picture. They’d be farther along if that pompous Willum had assisted rather than standing their watching Fenius (I don’t think anyone was surprised he tried to make off with a few tomes).
Not surprisingly it appears that the rest of our compatriots are still out, probably making fools of themselves. What is surprising is that Andri is actually not in her office. I’ll leave her to rest and track her down in the morning.

**The Next Morning**
Well that explains where Stardust was. I cannot say I am shocked that he would try but I will admit to being surprised by Andri. I guess her tastes have changed since I was last at the Monastery.

It seems like Andri already has a pretty good idea of the fallout from the expedition might be and seems to have that well in hand and will be taking appropriate action. Hopefully she will be able to send another expedition (now that she knows what to expect) because there is a wealth of knowledge and history in that city.

**After the Party Exchanges information**
Well it looks like Delg and Stardust found some more trouble. Somehow someone knows of the amulet and we have a somewhat short deadline. The group wisely decided to ask for assistance but of no surprise the Gatekeeper refused to offer full assistance. I cannot remember ever meeting one that would not be called stubborn. At least Stardust managed to talk him in to providing us an extra pair of eyes so if we disappear there will be a chance of rescue, assuming Andri hears and this Master Imrac does not just leave us to our fates.

**After the meeting with Malik**
At first I thought this would just be another case of nobles playing games with each other but it may be more serious. First off even these childish nobles would not go about killing each other over nothing. That was a dangerous fight our new ‘friend’ managed to drop us into but fortunately the assassin obviously did not count on Fenius and Stardust’s abilities. Secondly, the Draakhorn. I thought that thing disposed of where no one would get to it. How these children found it is something we need to find out because if they have found the Draakhorn then what else may they be able to unearth. But first we need to secure the Horn. Luckily my compatriots seem willing to take this Malik’s coin in exchange for delivering it to Tabhror (I was not going to permit it to be given to these children playing intrigue games). I’m sure Andri and other will want to study it but that is a problem for later. The last thing we need is for someone to be able to get the attention of a Chromatic Dragon. Right now none seem keen to mess with society but that can change and the Draakhorn is something that might change that. Once I dig up whatever other information the Library may have I think it will be time to gather up Sarya and head to Egley and this Lord Uthadar.
