**Day the First,**

Daybreak found Captain Stardust engrossed in discussion with the commander of our vessel, Captain Whitehouse. With mine own ears I heard the alien man cobble together a scheme whereby Whitehouse should see fit to releasing his goods into the care of Stardust’s soul-wracked deviltry. I shook my head in bemusement, for not even the sea-faring dwarf (!) seemed convinced. I must admit respect for Stardust’s ambition, if not his caution. I, for my part, reviewed means of flight from a potentially angry crew at sea. Finding none, I resorted to planning for methods of inflicting fear and anguish to carry the day in my favor, should the need arise. And as we were surrounded by an abundant supply of water, the probable conflagration couldn’t reliably be blamed on me. You see, a performer is always prepared.

By evening, I had Whitehouse’s nephew, Ruvul, following me around, as he was fascinated by my magic. No doubt even his pathetic level of “talent” for the arcane drew him to notice true power when presented. Uri entranced the boy with stories of dragons, while implying that I, The Great Transmuto!, held lesser knowledge of the great wyrms. Well, to that I say “tish!” In fact, I say, “tish!” and, “posh!” But the fool child, bedeviled by Uri’s obvious chicanery, actually began to divert his attention from it’s proper home: me, The Great Transmuto! Ever mindful of my solemn obligation to keep the world in balance, I impressed upon this second sea-faring dwarf (!) that if one should meet with a dragon, one should prefer the chromatic variety. To re-enforce the primacy of my knowledge and impress upon the crew my undoubted puissance, I performed for all and sundry at dinner. I considered it a good investment in the hope of saving them from any future need to inflict the horrible fate which awaits any who would oppose my ultimate power. Or chase me. Especially into the sea.

Given the effusive clapping, I considered the warning soundly delivered.

Later that evening, we greeted our wayward priest, Leeroy Jenkins. He arrived via hippogryph out of the sun, landing on deck with an extra such creature in tow. I noted with no small relief that the slaveboy did not arrive with him, despite the additional mount. Leeroy soon informed us that Drew had decided to make his own way in the world. Mayhap I could reunite with Drew in the future in order to bring ruin to the slavers and their sordid ilk, but until then I would no longer require forbearance in the meting out of proper justice, as only I, The Great Transmuto!, see fit.

It became clear that the priest’s holy manna was unfit for his newly-acquired beasts, who would not touch it, and the Captain informed us that he would not feed or groom the animals. Still, my eyebrows arched at Stardust’s next play; no sooner had Uri bargained for a huge discount on transporting the hippogryphs, than Leeroy and Stardust had teleported up to the Captain’s celestial conveyance with the beasts, thus obviating the need for such bargaining. I surmised that the two had left to indulge in some manner of debauchery, for surely nothing less would obtain aboard a soul-fueled demon engine. Clearly, this behavior was associated with a desire to feed Leeroy’s beasts, so I suspected more human sacrifice was in order. My vast store of demonic knowledge proved out, as they both appeared again shortly before arrival at Faelmal, minus the hippogryphs; Leeroy’s demeanor smacked of witchcraft, as he appeared dazed, twitchy, and bloated from his ordeal, while Stardust exhibited no such symptoms. Stardust offered me a personal review of Leeroy’s experience. Of course, I thought better of exposing myself to such machinations. A lord of arcanum must needs maintain his faculties at all times, least a hillock go missing, some goodwife’s cow produces sour milk from the teat — or mystic flames consume an orphanage. Flames that I, The Great Transmuto!, had no part in, o humble reader. Suggestions to the contrary being the foulest lies of the Pit, we must needs move on.

**Day the Second,**

We arrived at Faelmel’s port at midday. The town eclipsed humble Greycott in size, fairly teeming with vitality and industry. The place fairly begged to be cheat — I mean, entertained. Therefore, we immediately gave it a pass and headed straight for Maelhaven with all due haste. It’s clear, after all, that one can never trust large port towns too little. At least, I gathered such reasoning from Uri’s ever-accelerating drive to push on.

**Day the Third,**

On the road to Maelhaven, we were set upon by wretched assassins and knaves, bent on our demise. Unsure of their numbers, I decided to be merciful and break their bones en masse, rather than give in to the sweet siren song of total immolation. Thus did I elicit screams of agony from the hilltop on our left flank, as their bodies tore apart. Leeroy, taken by the a surge of holy wrath, did give into the song, and a mighty fireball did follow my magicks, wiping clean any assault from that quarter.

On our other flank, a war cry went up, and several bandits charged our position, engaging Uri and the others. The fools apparently didn’t realize whom they dealt with, as one even fired a crossbow bolt into mine own foot!

“Impudent fool!” I screamed, in order to mask the bone-jarring pain. My father told me once that the key to survival as a master of the Weave was concentration, so I smothered the pain into bolts of burning vengeance, which I used to scorch the assassin’s weak flesh thrice.

Even through the pain, I realized that Stardust had taken on some kind of demonic skin with which he could breath a green mist of fear at his assailant. The miscreant facing him dropped his weapon and fled, conveniently co-locating himself with the object of my wrath.

“Die!” I yelled, and pointed at my attacker. The tragedy one might call a man had not the time to fear his own demise, more’s the pity. The hillock upon which he stood exploded with a vicious shockwave, consuming both tree and man in a beatific conflagration.

So taken was I with my handiwork, I had almost forgotten the sloshing pool of blood in my boot, until that head-strong priest, Leeroy, thought better of allowing me to bleed to death. At the removal of the horrid bolt, quothe I: “Ow! Fucking shit! I said ‘Ow!’ ‘Ow’ means fucking don’t do that shit, you bastard priest! Dost thou wish to burn right quick?” And then I swooned in a manly fashion, but remained conscious while the wound closed by the power of the god of light.

Not to be outdone by the mere saving of my life, I cleaned my own boots with a great flourish of arcanum. No one noticed. But how could I expect the unlettered brutes of the world to know true power? Dismissing the slight as beneath me, I proceeded to ensure the permanence of my work at the end of my trusty club, The End. You see, the thorough mage is always rewarded.

As twilight faded to a starry night, we arrived at Maelhaven, marking my return to that wondrous metropolis. Many memories had I forged here. In fact, I was saddened to learn of the death of Master Gladdenstone at the University, and suspicious of the elevation of Mistress Andramia Elsinire, whom I have met. She seems to have a particular relationship with Uri, but considering that I suspect Uri of being a shriveled tree-hugger in the skin of a young man, that only stands to reason. Still, that is a story for another time, for we await audience with the woman. The wait would be more pleasant if Stardust would stop sizing me up for some kind of demon-ship deckhand position, simply because he chose that moment to realize the power of my magicks. I wish not to end up as our ill-used priest. Even now, days afterward, the cleric shakes when offered Stardust’s alien “doughnut” confection. Clearly, our troubles have only just begun.
