**Day the First,**

The party, having made peace by rite of combat and united in the spirit of larceny, agreed to be teleported to Captain Stardust’s celestial conveyance, whereupon I learned of the significant cost in souls required to propel his remarkable vessel between the stars. The captain had sacrificed a total of 29 hapless victims in his journey thus far. Though I had pored over my father’s materials concerning globes so large that to stand upon them would seem as though one stood upon a flat table, I hadn’t reckoned on the impact of seeing such from afar for myself, but there I stood, gazing at the world of my birth! However, Uri’s hard dealing with the Captain diverted my attention; the man claimed to use fortunes untold for mere wire! One must take care when hearing such tales, as the man attempted in his very next breath to barter with his own arm. Amused, and seeking the obvious sources of power capable of conveying mere mortals through the starry Abyss, I readily agreed to join his recovery crew for a five percent share and an upfront portion of platinum wire; I was confident of avoiding the fate of his previous associates. After all, I have studied to contend with the psychology of transplanar beings.

Upon returning to the surface, we made our way to Landow, where our erstwhile slaveboy, Drew, felt pity for a band of disreputable goblins who claimed to be on a quest to heal one of their juveniles. Unafraid of the green freaks, and willing to humor my companions for a bit of fun, we joined them with a promise of succor for their whelp. We arrived at their hovel, whereupon I gagged at the stench of impoverished goblinoid. I could tell even that mad dog Leeroy Jenkins would take ill if he remained too long, but in the end, he is a healer, so he deigned to touch the filthy heathen scrub. The mother cried in relief at not having to eat her own child for the next sacrifice to their bloodthirsty god. Unexpectedly, even Captain Stardust showed the evil ones pity, graciously repairing their dilapidated dwelling, all while employing the same lost souls as before. Refusing to be outdone by the fiendish display of generosity, I, The Great Transmuto!, amazed the awe-struck probable bandits with my powerful magicks. I allowed them to live as a warning to their brethren not to give chase — or suffer the wrath of my mystic flames.

**Day the Third,**

Soon we arrived at Pendle, where Drew attempted to hire a mercenary to work as fodder for the evil beings with whom we must at times contest. Unfortunately, the man held employment with a local lord. As befits his disreputable character, the Captain proceeded to threaten the lord for use of his man, which intrigued me, since I’d only recently acquired the use of fireballs through the Weave. However, the mercenary himself, sensing that our goals would not preclude the odd bit of wanton savagery, declined to take our gold. That’s what people get for raising filthy do-gooders. A clear sign of the End Times.

We made our way to Graycott, a port town on the shores of the Central Sea, seeking transport to Valwynne, for Uri judged that the cadre of unwashed tree-huggers at the University could somehow aid us in our quest to recover the good Captain’s cargo.

The party split, with Drew and Leeroy, headed to the Aviary to steal the hippogryphs from under the hated noses of the Feathergale Society and the rest of us heading to the docks to secure passage by sea.

The Captain, Uri, and I visited the most disreputable tavern I’ve ever had the displeasure of visiting, the Hard Donkey, and its higher-end counterpart the Captain’s Bounty, in order to find a ship leaving on our timetable. We discovered that the Drunken Trump, commanded by a dwarf named Captain Whitehouse, would set sail in the morning. For four gold a piece we manage to acquire passage thereon.

Satisfied with the deal, I made my way to the Aviary in order to inform Drew and Leeroy, only to discover their attempt to secure the hippogryphs had failed. Leeroy seemed suspiciously oblivious as to the cause of their failure, so I deduced that his mouth got him into trouble this time, since I could see no dead bodies nor hear an alarm. They asked me to aid them in assaulting the Aviary. I didn’t need a reason since I stood at the residence of the fiends whose organization murdered my brother, Lua Maan. So I proceeded to put one of the guards to sleep in passing, far from certain that such cheap tricks would work in the absence of my trusty club, but willing to allow the madmen their bloodthirst. I quickly passed beyond earshot of the ensuing chaos, making my way to the town square where I could relieve the good people of Graycott the burden of their heavy purses. It’s because I’m civic-minded, truly.

I could hear Leeroy’s fireball erupt in the distance, and I knew that all too soon my time pulling on the purse strings of Graycott would come to an end. Only later did I learn of Drew and Leeroy’s harrowing experience, cutting down the Birdbrains’ paid thugs and contending with their lord, who turned out to be a puissant mage. Of course, drinks would be in order, for our party had acquired several hippogrpyhs to ease our future travels. Filthy creatures, really, but I’m sure they eat goblins.
