# Text Data Log From Acting Captain Stardust
Siri, focus on the life support systems and recall the communicator that looks like it’s on a boat. There may be an issue with the charging pack and it needs to get some charge. Start checking power consumption levels on the communicators in the wild to see if they are discharging at a normal rate or look to be going to fast. We may have to cycle some of them so that we can keep opening portals when needed.

Siri, I know it’s a long shot, but try focusing the mineral scanners on the point that we entered this cave. See if we get lucky and find any signature of any of the materials that are listed in the engineering manifests. My notes on what was in the only container that I’ve been able to activate are in my home folder. Password is “Hunter1”.

Siri, I forgot to mention. Good job. You’re a quick study. Once the ship is crewed and stable I’ll teach you how to fly it. No creepy stuff like that Uri guy… I still can’t believe he would just randomly trip a stranger with a stick… what a jerk.

Siri, sending over video of Fen doing this weird ritual. See if you can clean up the feed and load it into the hologram index on my data pad. I should be able to replay it and create a hologram of him to get the same effect. There may be some variables that the ship can decode so I can change things. He said it’s an alarm and will send him a notification if it’s tripped. I’ve rigged things like that with motion sensors, but I’m hesitant to leave too much gear behind until we can get material replicators online. Btw, plug in option 43662 on the food replicator – it’s a dish called Sluvarian Cheesecake. It’s one of the closest recipes to what it’s supposed to taste like.

Siri, I know it’s not your real name. We don’t usually go by our real names. It can lead to trouble for those you care about… especially when you don’t have anything to trade for goods on a foreign back water planet.

Siri, sending back a single survivor. Should be back within 30 minutes of this message. Make sure you get one of those blasters reset and coded to you. It may sting a little, but it’s got enough firepower to at least give you a fighting chance. His name is Henry, once he cleans his pants start looking at putting together quick extraction gear so that we can get out of this pit faster. Who knows what we’ll be hauling back and we may need to get it up to the ship quicker. Also might be worth trying to set up repeaters to boost the signal as we go deeper into this complex. Do me a favor and see if you can get one of those researchers to send you all the info they can on this place. Old maps might be helpful as it doesn’t look like it’s been touched in ages.

Siri, I was thinking… there might be a way to stabilize the life support system for the number of people we’ve been hauling up. It would require boosting the feed power to the oxygen scrubbers and also getting the hydroponic food growers back online. There should be a botany manual in the cultivation run book. If you can get some of those lanterns they had at the book store I’m pretty sure knocking off the main lights will save 3% of energy production from the reactor. Go ahead and kill the external running lights. No reason to waste the juice since no one would be looking for a ship over this planet.

Siri, one of the guys mentioned these things are weak to radiant damage. Can you check on if it’s possible to modify the cells on these blasters to different formulas. One of the old crew guys used to tweak the wave settings to cause burn wounds so there’s got to be a way.

Siri, we sent back the bulk of the people we were sent to find. 2 or 3 members remain. Hopefully they’ll make it back but we don’t have time to escort them to the opening. We dealt with a few of these corpse things. <attached>. Get me any info you can on this stuff. Weakness and strengths would be helpful.

Siri, in case you start looking through the star charts, let me stop you. The space we plotted and jumped to isn’t charted. This place was a 1 in a million jump. The warp phaser wasn’t fully aligned when we made the jump. Hence the bodies in the walls. It was pretty much the only way to avoid a small intergalactic incident. The other downside to the jump was it caused a bunch of the old captain’s “buried treasure” routines to fire. Basically jettisoned all the storage containers to the orbited planet in the event we had been boarded. If we can get this thing running well it’s going to be a whole new adventure to make it back to charted space. Keep up the good work kiddo. Also if you decide to stick around and hit charted space, remind me to take you to the intergalactic cafe that has the best pizza. The stuff in the replicator is trash.

Siri, remind me to get some more booze. Being sober after dealing with the past few weeks is not fun. I really need a vacation.

Siri, do me a favor and let me know if you get any of these. It’s probably majorly delayed but at least it let’s me know things are working.

Siri, you should see if you can get another crew member sent up that can help you out. I know I’ve thrown a lot at you but there’s no way I can get this thing running solo and get the necessary equipment for the repairs. Seriously, ask if they’ll send you someone. Preferably with some martial experience to make sure anything coming through the portal is expected.

Siri, in case you’re wondering. I was the helmsman of the ship before the entire bridge crew died. The fool ruse might be up after we get back. But it’s mostly served it’s purpose.
