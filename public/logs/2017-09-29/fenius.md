**Day the Second, Continued,**

We were led to the study of the newly-minted Master Curator, Andramia Elsinire. Though I’d heard of the woman, no one had told me of her comeliness. Noting this, my eye immediately focused on the good captain; as expected, a lecherous leer already warped his features. The skilled wizard always seeks to anticipate the mettle of his companions, for who knows when a demon must needs be fed by their errant lusts in order to avoid vivisection? It is I, The Great Transmuto!, who knows, foolish reader! And the interval remains once every four blue moons, when discord ascends, and the blood-lust of men reaches its apogee among living souls. But I digress.

My gaze left the captain and took in the rest of the lady’s study since it might contain tomes of power and knowledge hitherto kept from the University’s great library. This is when I required my greatest restraint and forbearance since I did comprehend then at least three disturbing revelations. First, another elf of exceeding height stood to my left. Like the Master Curator, she seemed of middle age, were she a human. However, a strangeness surrounded her; I could not tell if her posture or proportions gave weight to this feeling, but there you have it. To call such a being an “elf” would be as like for a bovine to fit the designation of poodle. Nowise was this being an elf, though it’s true nature remained obscured. This conclusion was strengthened by our priest’s reaction; not much can startle the man, who was more likely to charge into battle than stay his hand, but this figure, whom the Master Curator had named Delg, had unnerved him. Definitely not normal. I turned my squinting eyes from Delg to her companion. Then did I receive my second shock. Before me, clear as day, stood the very model of a gnomish barbarian! Yes, I know, dear reader. I was raised in the gnomish tradition, and I’ve never heard of any burrow of barbarian gnomes. My first thought was that, clearly, the chap had gone insane. And yet, the others seemed to take this stupendous feat of lunacy in stride, the Master Curator herself sitting there as if all was well! Suspicious doesn’t cover it.

Then the third shock slowly dawned on me; gnomes and elves alike are long-lived. Many an evening did I find mine own mother worrying over the inevitability of being “young” when I’d reached my dotage. Recalling recent events, even Uri, that avaricious arcanist, claimed an age in advance of a century! And who knew how time flowed for one so strange as the captain, who traipsed betwixt the celestial domains? I was surrounded by ancients, riddled with the seeming of purloined youth to the last of them. Had it not been the way of the world from the beginning, I would have suspected demon taint!

The two suspects were introduced as associates of the field research team the University had sent to delve into claims concerning the long-lost city of Demrim! Demrim, I say! As if generations of scholars hadn’t been after the same, and yet the Master Curator claimed to have secured proof of its location. Amazing. But the researchers had failed to check in, and this weighed heavily upon the shoulders of the Master Curator.

Uri revealed that he’d been a monk with the monastery, and seeing his colleague’s distress, he felt moved to offer our services in order to find out what had become of the research team. At first, I was annoyed, and I thought to protest the diversion of our energies away from our own quest. However, despite his insufferable nature, I knew Uri for a greedy bastard. There was an angle here, beyond a desire to ingratiate himself romantically with the elf. Speaking of such, our good captain turned suitor even as I considered the idea of journeying to Demrim; he seemed to succeed in his charm offensive as well.

Really, I didn’t know hags could still feel enough heat to blush. I shuddered slightly at this display; geriatric fornication is a revolting affront against the natural order, obviously. I suspect such ignominious behavior explains the low birth rate among elves: they fail to explore their lust before the loinrot sets in. Also, they lived in trees, despite their palsied urban adaptations. Never trust tree dwellers, good readers. Even now that suspicious Delg reinforced this lesson, for who could trust such a being, an “elf” so she claimed? Right.

It was enough to tempt one unto conflagration, but I am no immolator of orphanages, and anyone who says otherwise is a damned liar born of the Pit and shall face the flames of my righteous wrath! But I digress.

Soon, the party broke up. Delg and Fubar the gnome barbarian (!) showed us where our rooms were, while the others went off to procure equipage for the journey. I went off to the library, for I suspected knowledge of Demrim would soon become important to us all. I kept an eye open for credible mention of lost treasure, but all such tales seemed too fanciful to hold.

**Day the Third,**

At dawn the next day we gathered to open passage to the captain’s vessel. Somehow, Stardust had managed to convince the ancient Master Curator to lend an acolyte of hers into servitude aboard his ship. Assuming Uri had worried her overmuch, I saw fit to inform the lady that her student need not worry about her soul, as the demonic engine had had its fill of late. Her expression, as we left, told me that the burdens of her office never left her shoulders. At least she has the energy of stolen youth to carry the weight, so I can’t pity her.

Stardust immediately set the student, the so-called Acolyte Sarya Glynlee, to work cleaning up hippogryph shit. The lass seemed quite sharp, and despite her initial disgust, had the ship’s systems working as hard as herself on the tasks, not to mention a growing infatuation with Stardust’s portable witchery. Fortunately for the acolyte, Stardust deigned to repair his vessel sufficiently such that she didn’t die while fawning over the captain’s celestial gimcracks. I’d think the man was merciful if our entire partnership weren’t based on larcenous instincts.

We soon opened a portal back to the surface beside the wreckage that had originally led us to the captain’s acquaintance, and in short order, we set out to find Demrim and the lost research team.

Week the Fourth, Day the First,

Four days journey saw at the foot of a mountain with a fissure exposed upon its face. Within, clear as day, stood obvious dwarven works: stair steps, carvings, and columns of all sorts. Therein, amid the gloom, did we find the ransacked remains of the research team’s campsite. The area lay riddled with signs of struggle, so we pushed on in hopes of finding a sing of their survival. We spread out, descending via a wide spiral staircase; Delg took the lead, which suited me just fine. How could she be trusted at my back?

In short order I sensed a familiar presence, one not felt since my time in the dungeons of the cult that had held Drew captive: Duergar!

Rage filled me at their repeated impudence. How dare they sneak among us with their cheap tricks?!

Without warning, I shouted, “Burn!” The hallway erupted in the flame and fury of my arcane outrage, shocking several of the loathsome scum into visibility. Then did I hear the strangeness of a gnomish war cry, as Fubar threw a hatchet into the skull of one of the singed fiends. His tiny form shot passed me amid the frenzy and fire, and then did I witness the carnage wrought by gnomish barbary. I shall not recount it, for I know the delicate sensibilities of my readers. Let us simply say that fiend felled fiend most assuredly.

After the battle, I assured the doom of my foes in the proper way with my club, lest they come amongst us again in unlife. Still, I felt uneasy, for it was clear that more of the cowardly bastards infested these gloomy environs. The Duergar Hunt had come upon us unbidden — but welcome. The need to burn in good cause had been held in check for long enough. With no worthy tomes at stake, the world was once again alight with unsinged flesh.
