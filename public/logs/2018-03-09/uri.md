# Forays in Egley

**After the ship lands**
This ship is like nothing I have seen. First it falls from the sky to land safely on the water and then the rocking is such that almost as soon as I walk outside I find myself ready to feed the fish.

To make matter worse, Leeroy chooses now to track me down and begin interrogating me. Apparently he’s more perceptive than he lets one. He saw what I did in the warehouse and has pieced together that I am older than I’ve already let on. If he was less reckless I might be more willing to answer some of his questions.

**The night before we reach Egley**
Sarya and Stardust have been spending most of their time since the ship hit the water crawling around within it pulling things a part and sticking them back together in what look to be piles of dead snakes. She really does have a knack for this “technology” as I’ve heard Stardust refer to it. I have been leaving her to on her own for the moment as I do not want to pressure her and drive her away from the Monastery. Maybe I’m a bit scared as well. I’ve never been good with people and worse with the very young. I see the time she spends with Stardust and my head tells me I should keep them as separate as possible while allowing her to learn but only a fool would not see that he has real affection for her and means her no ill. In addition he appears to be a skilled teacher; he does not just help her find the knowledge but is able to fuel her thirst for more. That is a rare gift.

As they work together I wonder what will happen when he finds out he’s been teaching someone older than him, albeit still a youth.

At some point I am going to need to sit down and at least outline an outline for how all this information is going to put together. With luck I will find an eager student and not have to go back to Andri and tell her that I drove her apprentice away.

**After the first night in Egley**
Looks like Delg has been busy. Maybe a little bit too busy. Whatever he is he has no subtlety to him. He’s running around in his absurd disguises making noise and trying to force people to do his bidding which seems to work sometimes but the others he just seems like the fool. Right now the last thing we need is a fool. It looks like we’re going to have to break in to the Builders guild to get a map of the estate. Fortunately the security seems to match what Delg said and Fenius did not detect any magic. Hopefully we’ll be able to keep everything quiet enough to steal the plans and then use the cover stories Delg secured for us to then steal the Draakhorn. If things do go bad I believe Fenius will also be ready to make an escape. I’ll have to remember to make sure Stardust is ready too and then we’ll just have to drag Leeroy with us if we can.

**After the fight at the Alchemists Guild**
I think I got hit with four different fireballs today. Apparently only Fenius has enough caution to actually aim away from me when he can

With luck when Stardust gets back he’ll be able to help reign in the insanity.

As I look at what I wrote I find it hard to believe.
