# The calm before the storm

The gentle sounds of waves lapping along the length of the hull provide a rhythmic calm to the otherwise chaotic feel in the air. The taste of brine and fresh air mingle on the tongue as the lights in the nearby harbor twinkle hello. Looking above at the foreign sky, the stars look different, so foreign yet so familiar in their constant gaze. The roll of the ship provides a gentle rock that would in better times lull one to sleep with little effort.

The Captain mutters as the task at hand appears to cause more frustration than a reprieve. The sheer volume of work and lack of materials would make the situation maddening for most, even with a full crew. To find oneself in a situation where you’re left to tinker with a problem and discover a workaround might be exciting to some, but when, you’ve been thrust upon a new world alone the frustrations can be insurmountable.

“It’s a good thing the bottles are empty.” The Captain muttered to himself.
“What was that stuff anyway?” Siri asked as she continued tracing a rats nest of cables across the deck.
“Highly concentrated alcohol… it’s usually diluted with water or some other liquid to about 20% of its potency. Have to remember that on long voyages, you have to condense as much as possible.”
“Why would you drink that without diluting it then?”
“Have you ever experienced loss of everything? Not to be dramatic, but my entire crew… my only way home… gone in an instant, then blackness…” He sighed gently as he tightened a coupling and watched a small light switch from red to green.
“Where are you even from?” She asked as she looked up in time to see the Captain quickly hide a look of despair.
“A medium-sized planet called Elara the star cluster Euphrates that I can’t even identify in your night sky. It was mostly covered in water, so travelers decided it was a good enough waystation to setup a port as well as an orbiting starbase. It’s nothing too remarkable and considered by many to be a bit on the rural side of things. I don’t think I even set foot on actual land until I was in my teens… The colonists built platforms in the vast oceans to live and harvest the minerals below. Growing up you didn’t have much choice about living on the sea. Especially, if you weren’t born to wealth. I spent much of my childhood learning how to sail and live on the water, thinking there wasn’t much else… I was so wrong. Around my 14th birthday, my father took me up to orbit to trade… that’s when I saw our planet below. Just a large blue ball, nothing remarkable… I think that’s the same moment I decided I wanted more.” He sighed slightly, and a smile curled at the edge of his lips. “Now look at me… I’m a space pirate stuck on a large blue ball.”

He chuckled to himself at this and just shook his head. Siri saw the pain behind his eyes but didn’t want to press much further as she was sure that the story would continue to unfold as time went by. Pushing too much now might put him off of sharing in the future, she thought. It was going to be a delicate balance to understand this strange being from a different world. But so many questions… so many things that were so quick to come to her mind but when to ask? When to dig deeper. How could she push to learn these things without damaging the relationship? So much was different here, she was encouraged to explore, not forbidden from anything. The secrets that she discovered were met more with encouragement than being told to stay the course and not look beyond what you’re told. The softness the captain provided was more like a father than a teacher. It was one that showed pride when she did well and gave warning when she was erring too close to getting herself in trouble. Almost as though she was a stand-in for something… or someone.

The Captain pulled on a rope that Siri hadn’t even paid attention to. As he hauled it up, she noticed that there was a large net with something squirming inside. It looked like, could it be? Yes! The Captain had hauled in a net full of fish!

“Looks like we’ll have a real meal tonight. I hope you’re not too squeamish as I’ll need some help to gut these. I can make a smoker out of one of the empty water barrels and some tubing.” He remarked with a sly grin. “I have no idea about what species these are, but hopefully this world isn’t too different in what we can eat.”

The Captain got to work putting together a couple of strange contraptions on the deck of the ship. Siri began making short work of cleaning the fish. The upbringing of a child of the forest truly lent itself to the task at hand. Bringing the processed fish back on deck the Captain beamed at his creation. Faint blue smoke rose from the chimney of tubing attached to the barrel. He whistled a happy tune as he began laying the fish on grates layered inside.

“Do we have any lemon? Maybe some garlic? Are those even things in this world?” He mused as he closed the lid on the barrel and checked the fire he had created in the box next to it. “I never know how this translation thing works, does it give you an approximation of the idea I’m thinking of? Is it a direct translation? It’s kind of like, do I see color the same as you see a color and we’ve just learned the name of 2 different colors, but that’s the way we see them…”
She laughed and went below deck to look through the provisions that had been acquired. She knew there was at least some lemon even if there wasn’t any garlic. She had never had to consider what was available at the monastery; it was just taken for granted. Now, supplies needed to be considered and rationed when necessary. This could easily be a bit more of a challenge than she expected. She knew that some clerics could summon the bounty from their gods, but that was less than ideal. The food was always bland and didn’t help soothe the pains of the day. Something about the idea of having fresh fish made her decide that when they went back to port, she would make sure to acquire various spices, things to make food the common language and a bond for those who would travel aboard the Arcadia.

Siri came up to the deck and placed the lemons by the Captain as he was tapping into his datapad.

He looked up at her and smiled, “You’re a gem, thank you. The fish should be ready in a bit. Sit back and relax for a while, we’ve still got a lot of work ahead of us, and we can’t make any reasonable progress if we’re exhausted.” He went back to tapping into the datapad.

Captain’s Journal – First night at sea
_I see something in Siri that makes me think of home, the spirit that hasn’t been broken yet and thirsts to experience what life is. I think that in time she will be at peace with deciding to venture this path. I know others may think I have predictions for chasing every lovely creature I see if they only knew the truth and the real reason I yearn to make my way home. I know that once things are completed, I’ll be asking Siri to follow in my footsteps and leave everyone she knows and cares about behind. I would certainly feel as though I betrayed her if I didn’t give her that choice, but I don’t know how I could continue to move forward if she chose to remain. She has shown an aptitude for learning the ship’s systems that took me months to fully understand. It’s like she’s being guided by some voice or hand in the right direction as she delves into schematics and manuals. Maybe the monistaries love of books and research is paying off more than I give it credit… I just wonder how she’ll handle some of the more complicated subsystems that take years even to begin to understand the theory behind them.

I’m really glad Siri decided to come along, I think as time goes by and she sees the real freedom that she can have she’ll adapt to this way of life easier. The life of a monk seems so far from really understanding the true natures of the universe and finding real serenity. What good is a book in reading about someone else’s life when you have the opportunity to write your own story? Sometimes the tale will veer and weave in ways that no author could ever fully anticipate or craft. The mysteries that unfold on the hidden paths which we walk carry more weight than the fine script written in books. While books have the power to remember, they can’t live. You can live vicariously through the exploits and adventures of others, but is that the same? Is it not refreshing to walk along and smell the air perfumed with fragrances both divine and fowl? To be locked away inside a musky library drudging up the thoughts of people who long dead seem tedious. I will admit that scholarship does have merits, but to cloister oneself into such worlds leads to much tedium that doesn’t refresh the spirit._

There was something in his smile; it almost set her at ease. Like a friend who knew what to say and when to say it. The worries of leaving home to come on this strange voyage seemed to disappear. It was strange, when she knew she could just open the portal and go back to the monastery, the distance didn’t seem so great. Now here she was, further than she had ever been from home on a grand adventure. She felt both anxiety and elation at the idea. This was her moment, the chance she had to see and discover things that were never known to her before. This strange man, he seemed to care about her but not in a romantic way. He looked at her as though she were his daughter; it was strangely comforting.

Time passed with both Siri and the Captain relaxing. The thoughts of the troubles delayed as the aroma of smoked fish wafted through the air. The grin on the Captain’s face when he inspected the finished product was nothing less than infections. The plating was simplistic with the only accompaniment being a simple wedge of lemon. The simplicity was part of the charm, the freshness of the fish with the light flavor of smoke combined with the burst of citrus made for something so beautiful tears welled in Siri’s eyes.

“Are you ok?” The Captain asked with a bit of concern in his voice.
“I’m wonderful… everything is so… beautiful,” She said while wiping her nose on her sleeve and a smile on her face. She quickly took another bite and began laughing at how silly she felt for all these emotions that were stirred up inside her. The Captain smiled as they both ate until their bellies were full and the fatigue of the day began to set.

As they finished cleaning up and putting away the remaining fish, the Captain looked up. “Try to get some rest; we’re going to have to run a lot of tests tomorrow. It’s probably going to be tedious, and we’re very likely to find a lot of other issues to deal with as we go.”

As they went below to settle for the night. Siri made sure that the alarms that she had prepared were all active and working as expected. Everything appeared to be for a good night of rest. Tomorrow would bring new challenges that would need creative solutions to solve. A tired mind couldn’t think about the problem and would quickly run against the wall. The best thing was to get some sleep.

Siri couldn’t sleep, she kept thinking about some of the alerts and messages that had continued to plague her as she was trying to fix other issues. Something wasn’t right. Why did this all come so easily to her? Why did it feel like every time she went to find the answer to a question the Captain asked her it was almost at her fingertips before she was done typing it? Something was happening; something was pulling her to look in specific places, to make her consider specific things. Something beyond her, something larger. What was it?

In his quarters, the Captain continued to stare at his console blurry eyed and frustrated. He just shook his head as he contemplated getting some sleep.

Captains Journal – First night at sea, 0300 as close as I can approximate

Ugh, it’s so frustrating, I’ve been looking at this subroutine for hours, it just doesn’t make sense. It’s like it’s trying to reprogram itself… almost like it’s trying to get rid of a virus or a worm snaking through the machine. Is that why Phoenix isn’t coming online? Is it fighting an infection? Could the agents of the Maelstrom empire have infected us? But they were locked up, and the brig isn’t safe to investigate yet, at this point even if they did survive they should have died from exposure. There must be something else… something that I’m just not seeing. I should probably move over to looking at weapons systems and see if I can get some protection setup so that we don’t have to leave the ship defenseless. Siri has been working on taking the alarm ritual that she’s been able to replicate not just from Fen’s videos but also from the actual text. She’s working on creating an alarm system for the entire ship… I think she has the itch not to be confined to the ship when we’re in port; I can’t say I blame her. If we can get the weapon systems back online and deal with any intruders, I’m sure that will give us both peace of mind. I’m about to the point where I’m going to reboot the entire system and see if that helps, it was too dangerous when life support might not come back online, but now the worst case is that we’re floating aimlessly in the water… we should probably do this when we are in port again to pick everyone up and figure out the plan. This will have to wait until then. I’ve got to get some sleep, or I’ll be useless tomorrow when we start testing some of the subsystems.

The Captain stumbled his way to his bunk, hoping the night wouldn’t be filled with nightmares of the journey to end up in this galaxy, or plane of existence… Where is he? Where is home? Do people even know what happened? Does she know? The thoughts crashed around his head like Uri’s attempts to sneak around. They ground on his mind until the sweet darkness came to let him drift off.

“WOO WOO WOO” the alarm made its presence known and was quick to inform that it was time to start the day.

The sound ruined the peaceful dream that had started to put a smile on the Captain’s face. It was a dream of her. If only he could see her for one more moment, to let her know that he was still alive. Was he still alive? Had he died, and this is the afterlife? Why did the afterlife have to smell like a combination of body odor and fertilizer?

The Captain stumbled about his cabin, doing his best to prepare for what laid ahead. He was uncertain of how much would be accomplished today, but he knew that it was needed. Slowly getting dressed he punched the button to have a cup of coffee created from the replicator. The alert to notify that food and drink resources were almost depleted displayed, almost as a way to taunt him into action. How could this planet be so damn backward he mused as he took his first sip.

“DAMN IT!” Exasperation on full display as he spits out that first taste. “I guess brown water is all we have left… Leroy is going to be pissed when he finds out there aren’t any more chips.”

The captain moved to the galley to see if he could rustle up breakfast and make a general plan with Siri. To his surprise, she was sipping on something that smelled like it might wake him from the groggy stupor he was trying to shake off.

“What’s that?” He said pointing at the cup she was drinking from.
“It’s yurb… most people drink it to help sharpen their senses as well as push away tiredness. I think it’s sort of like the tea that you have programmed in the replicator, but doesn’t taste as bitter.” She remarked, trying to be gracious in the fact he still was so much like a child with his knowledge of this world. Where he understood the complex mechanics and machinery of this ship, he had no real grasp on the things that many people took for granted. Even though he looked like he fit in on this planet, he was still from another world, she mused with a bit of a smirk sneaking onto her face.
“I don’t suppose there’s more? My normal routine is being disrupted by our lack of being able to resupply the replicators. I doubt we’ll ever get those working in this world.”
“Sure, pots still warm, I’d suggest adding some honey a maybe a touch of the milk from the cold box.”
The Captain quickly made a cup as suggested and sipped at it with a bit of apprehension. As the taste hit his lips, he realized that the flavor was very soothing, not at all as rough as what he was used to. Maybe there was some hope for this world; maybe it had the potential to be worth exploring to see what other things might be worth trading. His thoughts raced for a moment with possibilities as the leaden feeling of grogginess left his mind. The acuity that was replaced seemed surreal in many ways. The day had just begun, and now it was time to see what was possible.

Siri and the Captain planned out a few basic tests to perform and spent the remained of the day and into the early evening testing and working to try and see what was possible now that this heavenly vessel was firmly located in the ocean.

*Captain’s Journal – Day 2 a bit past last meal, why haven’t these fools devised working clocks?
*
_This ship… so many fears of what happens if it’s not able to carry me back to the stars… What choice did I have though, either it becomes a floating tin can. At least by bringing it down to this planet, I can buy some time to figure out how to get it fully operational again. Siri and I have begun testing to determine how the systems fare now that we aren’t able to broadcast signals as far. The good news is that we can still utilize our portal capabilities… the bad news is that it looks like the most distance we can get is about 5 miles. This wouldn’t be too big of a deal, but we also have to have line of sight to the sky… even wooden structures seem to degrade the signal enough that the portal can’t be established. Siri and I both should be able to get 2 uses a day out of the portal. I’ve tasked Siri with creating new transponders that we can place in the ports we visit so we don’t have to risk bringing the ship close to shore when we need to disembark or resupply. The goal is to mask the way they look so that they’ll blend in well enough that they won’t be discovered.

We’ve made some progress on getting more subsystems online. There’s a lot that we can’t do until we can find more of the containers that have some of the replacement parts… It’s strange, I’ve been looking over the manifest of the container systems that were ejected, and some of them contained life support systems. Could anyone else have made it out alive? What if… what if… I need to push some of these thoughts from my mind or else I’ll drive myself crazy with what could be, right now I just need to focus on the tasks at hand… The Phoenix AI looks like it might be ok, but it’s not fully operational atm. I think that if I could get the AI back online, we might be able to repair some of the more technical systems to come online quicker with guidance… I just hope it doesn’t lead me to second-guessing myself; I think that’s why we got here. I should have gone with my instinct instead of trusting the AI… I should have put in the course that would have pushed us to a known instead of to a possibility… but the captain trusted Pheonix’s rational explicitly. Why trust the computer more than the pilot? Why have a pilot if you’re just going to defer to the computer.

The others should be about ready to embark on whatever news they’ve discovered. We’ll go to port tomorrow and see what the situation is and devise a plan. Hopefully, Delg hasn’t found himself in some sort of trouble. I wonder about him; there are some things about him that remind me of things I’ve read in that book by that Volo guy… interesting stuff. I wonder if we’ll ever run into the illithids, the gith that they enslaved seem more interesting and I’d love to learn more about them._
